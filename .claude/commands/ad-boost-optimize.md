# Ad Boost Campaign Optimization (Browser-Driven)

Input: $ARGUMENTS — provider name(s), Google campaign ID(s), or nothing.

## Two modes

| | **Sweep mode** (no arguments) | **Targeted mode** (`/ad-boost-optimize Rosemonte`) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Every campaign currently serving | Only the named provider(s) / campaign ID(s) |
| Phase 1 | Full query + prioritization + skip rules | Resolve the name to a campaign ID, then straight to Phase 2 |
| Phase 2 read | Fixed comparable set, same for all | Same set **plus** whatever the specific complaint requires — ad-level performance, geo report, ad schedule, change history |
| Depth | Stop at the diagnosis table | Keep going until the campaign is actually explained |
| Output | Cross-campaign table + decision list | One campaign, full narrative: what's wrong, why, what was changed, what to watch |
| Use when | Routine 3-4 day maintenance | Something specific looks broken, TJ asks about one provider, or a campaign just came back from a fix and needs its 48h re-read |

Sweep mode is the default and the one that should run on a cadence. **Targeted mode is not "sweep mode with a filter"** — a sweep triages the book and moves on, a targeted run does not stop at "negatives look fine," it keeps digging until the number is explained. If a sweep flags a campaign as anomalous, the follow-up is a targeted run on that one.

**This command maintains. It does not diagnose.** When a campaign's number cannot be explained from the Phase 2 read — zero impressions on an Eligible campaign, a flight that converted and a rebuild that did not, a provider whose two flights disagree — stop and run **`/ad-boost-audit`** on it. That command reads internal data and Google together, across flights, and writes case files. This one only reads what a sweep needs.

**A bare invocation always sweeps.** No arguments means sweep — do not ask TJ which campaigns he meant, do not narrow it, just run the book. An attached screenshot alone does **not** switch modes here: it is context, not a target list. (This deliberately differs from `/ad-boost-setup`, where a screenshot of the Requested queue *does* pick the providers — that command acts on a queue, this one acts on everything serving.) Only an explicitly named provider or campaign ID in the text switches to targeted mode.

If arguments name a provider with more than one campaign (a revived flight 2, or a provider running two cities), list them and ask which — do not guess and do not do both silently.

## Purpose

The recurring mid-flight maintenance sweep for campaigns that are already running. `/ad-boost-setup` builds campaigns; this one keeps them from bleeding. It is the same work as that command's Phase 3.5 (search-terms harvest) and Phase 3.6 (revive), lifted out so it can be run across the whole live book on a cadence instead of once per build.

**Run this every 3-4 days.** On a 2-week flight there are only ~3 useful sweeps before the money is gone.

Canonical references (read if uncertain, don't re-derive):
- `/ad-boost-setup` — locked invariants, direct URLs, campaign ID registry, all Google Ads automation gotchas.
- Notion SOP: "SOP — Managed Ads (Ad Boost): Google Ads Campaign Setup (any provider)" (id `38d5903a-0ffe-818f-a75b-db0951f7b178`).
- Memory: `project_managed_ads_setup_sop`, `project_adboost_outcome_blindness`.

## Read this before harvesting a single negative

This command's original thesis was that category-adjacent and competitor-brand queries are waste, and that negatives are "the only lever that compounds." That thesis was measured on one campaign (HomeWell, 119 terms, 4 named clicks, zero leads) and then rolled across the whole home-care book as a 98-term shared list between 2 and 23 August 2026.

**The 4 September audit found the opposite pattern, and the rule below replaces the old one.**

- Every inquiry in the program's history came from a campaign running **six or fewer** negatives during its flight. No campaign running 48 or more has produced one. At the earlier rate, P(zero across the 105 clicks in the high-negatives group) ≈ 1%.
- Franchil's June flight — the best result ever, 3 inquiries at ~$12 on 124 impressions — served almost entirely on `rosewood villas killeen`, `nursing homes killeen`, `assisted living killeen tx`, `memory care killeen tx`, `visiting angels killeen tx`. Exactly the buckets this command used to negate on sight. **Its 3 conversions came from those 16 clicks.** The shared list, applied to the August rebuild, removed that query pool; the campaign served 1 impression in 12 days.
- HomeWell — the campaign the list was built from — produced zero leads *before* it had any negatives. Wrong-category traffic did not cause that zero.

**The rule now:** a search term is not waste because it names a competitor or a different care category. It is waste only if it is *unambiguously not a family seeking care*. That means jobseeker terms (`jobs`, `hiring`, `careers`, `salary`, `resume`, `become a caregiver`, `certification`, `training`, `visa`, `sponsorship`) and nothing else by default. A family searching "nursing homes killeen" is in crisis and open to any answer; a family searching "visiting angels" is comparison shopping and may well take the second option they see. **Both are leads.**

Negating a category or a competitor is a hypothesis, not a hygiene step. It gets logged as a `tweak` in `ad_campaign_log` with an expected signal and a review date, like any other change, and it gets reversed if the review says it cost impressions without saving money.

**The list this command built still exists** (`provider managed ads negative keywords`, sharedSetId `12134249254`, 98 terms, on 9 campaigns as of 4 Sep). Do not attach it to anything new. Do not add to it. Removing it from the 8 campaigns still carrying it is a pending decision that waits on Franchil's 7 Sep review.

## Do NOT thrash

$50 ÷ ~$2.00 CPC = ~25 clicks per flight. At ~3% landing conversion that is **~0.7 expected leads**, so **roughly half of correctly-built campaigns will show zero leads and nothing is wrong.** Zero leads is not a signal. Zero *clicks* with impressions is a signal. Know the difference before touching anything.

Never change keywords and negatives in the same pass — the read becomes unattributable. Sequence is fixed: **negatives → wait 48h → re-read CTR → only then consider a keyword rebuild.** The one exception is a campaign at zero impressions, where there is nothing to attribute anyway; there, restore the prior flight's proven configuration in one move and log it as such.

**Every change this command makes is a `tweak` in `ad_campaign_log`** — `POST /api/admin/ad-boost/case` with `expected_signal` and `review_after`, or the database rejects it. Reading Google and not writing the case is the same mistake as reading Google and not writing the numbers back. The overdue-review badge on `/admin/ad-boost` is what makes the 48h re-read actually happen.

## Phase 0 — Browser up (`/open-dia`, FIRST ACTION of every sweep)

**Invoke `/open-dia`.** Not "read it," not "follow its principles from memory" — invoke it, so its rules are actually loaded: snapshot before screenshot, viewport set deliberately, TJ handles every auth wall, irreversible clicks gated. Everything below assumes a live, visible window.

Then, in this order:

1. **Is the automation browser even running?**
   ```bash
   pgrep -f "remote-debugging-port=9222" && curl -s --max-time 5 http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version
   ```
2. **If it is not running, hand-launch it.** This account runs the MCP in **attach mode** (`--browserUrl http://127.0.0.1:9222` in `~/.claude.json`), so it will *not* launch a browser for you, and `/open-dia`'s kill → `new_page` relaunch path does not apply here. Pass the URL argument — without it Dia can come back windowless:
   ```bash
   nohup /Applications/Dia.app/Contents/MacOS/Dia \
     --user-data-dir=/Users/tfalohun/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile \
     --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
     --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check --restore-last-session=false \
     --window-size=1440,900 --window-position=40,40 \
     "https://ads.google.com/aw/campaigns?ocid=984737409" \
     >/tmp/dia-9222.log 2>&1 &
   sleep 9; curl -s --max-time 5 http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version   # must return JSON
   ```
3. **Prove the window is visible before touching anything:**
   ```
   evaluate_script: () => ({ innerW: innerWidth, innerH: innerHeight, outerW: outerWidth, outerH: outerHeight })
   ```
   **`outerW`/`outerH` of 0 means the process is alive but windowless.** Snapshot and evaluate keep working, so the session looks fine while TJ sees nothing, and you will not find out until the first screenshot times out. Relaunch per step 2 rather than papering over it with `emulate`.
4. **Expect a Google auth wall and budget for it.** `tj@olera.care` re-auths often, including a "Verify it's you" on a freshly launched profile. `select_page` with `bringToFront: true`, tell TJ exactly what to click, and wait. **Never type credentials.** This is a hard stop, not something to work around — so raise it early rather than after the DB work.

Phase 1 needs no browser, so if TJ is mid-auth, **run Phase 1 while waiting** and present its findings instead of idling.

## Phase 0.5 — Session guard (once per sweep, before any campaign)

Open `https://ads.google.com/aw/recommendations/autoapply?ocid=984737409`. Both cards must read **"0 of 7 selected"** and **"0 of 14 selected"**. If anything is on, uncheck it — then **navigate away and click Save in the leave-confirmation modal** (the top-of-page Save button is the workspace filter save and does nothing here). Reload to confirm.

This is the account's main silent-drift vector. It is what re-enables AI Max, reverts keywords to Google defaults, and re-adds the "Olera.care" headline.

## Phase 1 — Build the sweep list (no browser)

**Targeted mode:** run the same query filtered to that provider — you still need the row `id`, `campaign_tag`, and `flight_start_date` for the Phase 5 write-back — then resolve to the Google campaign ID and go. Skip only the prioritization. Still run Phases 0 and 0.5 — the browser has to be up either way, and auto-apply drift is account-wide, so one campaign is enough to catch it.

**There is no Google campaign ID column on this table.** The mapping is by campaign name / `campaign_tag` against the registry, which is why the registry has to be maintained by hand.

Query prod `ad_campaign_requests` (service-role key is in `.env.local`; never ask TJ for it):

```sql
select id, display_name, provider_slug, campaign_tag, status,
       flight_start_date, flight_end_date, admin_note,
       ad_clicks, ad_impressions, ad_spend_cents, ad_budget_cents,
       created_at, ended_at
from ad_campaign_requests
where status in ('live','scheduled') and deleted_at is null
order by flight_end_date asc nulls last;
```

**Days-in-flight is measured from `flight_start_date`, never `created_at`.** `created_at` is when the provider requested, which routinely runs weeks ahead of launch (Legacy Haven requested Jul 1 for a Jul 6 flight). Using it silently misprioritizes the whole sweep. If `flight_start_date` is null on a live row, that is itself a data gap worth reporting.

Then map each row to its Google campaign ID. **The registry lives at the bottom of `/ad-boost-setup` Phase 2** (HomeWell `24052308622` · Legacy Haven `24062146484` · Miracle-Lightstar Jul `23998344651` · **Miracle-Lightstar Aug `24151612515`** · Impact `23998367469` · Abode `23981427299` · Rosemonte `24126008389` · **Franchil Jun `23961292547`** · **Franchil Aug `24166094865`** · **Graceful Aug `24162206362`** · **Edmonds Aug `24094557242`** · **Edmonds Sep `24176699440`**; bold ones verified 4 Sep 2026). **A provider can have more than one ID.** Franchil and Miracle each have two campaign objects, and the case that explains the current one usually lives in the previous one — read both. Anything not listed: read `/aw/campaigns?ocid=984737409`, match on campaign name `{Provider} – {City} – {Mon YYYY}`, and **write the new ID back into that table in `ad-boost-setup.md`** so the next sweep doesn't re-derive it.

Prioritize the list:

| Situation | Priority |
|---|---|
| 3-7 days since launch, never harvested | **Highest** — this is where the money is still recoverable |
| ≥3 days since the last harvest line in `admin_note` | High |
| Flight ends in <3 days | High, different purpose — the terms feed the flight-2 revive, not this flight |
| Launched <3 days ago | Skip, no data yet |
| `status='scheduled'` but not actually serving | Not an optimization problem — check the launch, then hand to `/ad-boost-setup` |

**Note which campaigns still carry the shared list** — `Level` column reads `List` on their Negative keywords page. As of 4 Sep that is 9 campaigns; Franchil Aug had it detached. Assisted-living providers (Rosemonte, Edmonds) never had it, because it negates `"assisted living"` — and that same reasoning, that a list can negate a campaign's actual intent, is what the 4 Sep audit found had happened to the home-care campaigns too. Treat the list as a suspect on every campaign carrying it, not as protection.

## Phase 2 — Per-campaign read (gather before judging)

For each campaign, pull the same fixed set so verdicts are comparable across the book. Use the direct URLs — in-app nav hides or 404s most of these.

1. **Campaign row** — `/aw/campaigns?ocid=984737409`: status (Eligible / Eligible (Limited) / Ended), budget, spend-to-date, clicks, impressions, CTR, avg CPC.
2. **Impression share** — same page, Columns → Modify columns → **Competitive metrics**: `Search lost IS (rank)` and `Search lost IS (budget)`. Without these you cannot tell "losing auctions" from "budget-capped," and the fix is different.
3. **Search terms** — `/aw/keywords/searchterms?campaignId={id}&ocid=984737409`, **Show rows: 50**, read every term. For an ended campaign set the date range to **All time**; the default window renders empty and looks like "no data."

   **The report is partial by construction and you must say so in the readout.** Google only exposes search terms above a privacy threshold, so `Total: Search terms` is routinely a fraction of the campaign's real numbers — Pacesetter showed **2 of 13 clicks and 49 of 149 impressions** on 2026-08-14, with the balance hidden under `Total: Other search terms`. Compare the two totals every time. A clean-looking harvest on a campaign with 15% term visibility is not evidence the spend is clean; it is evidence you cannot see it. Never report "no waste found" without the visibility ratio next to it.
4. **Keywords** — `/aw/keywords?campaignId={id}&ocid=984737409`: note which have zero impressions, and **read the live set before writing any negative** (Phase 3).
5. **Existing negatives** — `/aw/keywords/negative?campaignId={id}&ocid=984737409`: read the `Level` column. Shared list shows as `List`, campaign-level as `Campaign`. You only need the delta.
6. **AI Max toggle** — campaign Settings, confirm `aria-checked=false`. It silently re-enables and its URL expansion strips `utm_campaign`, which kills attribution.

**Targeted mode adds** — pull these only when the campaign is the subject, they are too expensive for a sweep:

- **Change history** (`/aw/changehistory?ocid=984737409` — verified): the fastest answer to "why did this change?", including changes Google made on its own.
- **Device split** (`/aw/devices?campaignId={id}&ocid=984737409` — verified) — read only. **Never set a device bid adjustment**; see the locked invariant in `/ad-boost-setup`.
- **Ad-level performance** (`/aw/ads?campaignId={id}&ocid=984737409` — **verified 2026-08-14**): ad status (Eligible / Disapproved) and Ad Strength. First thing to check on any near-zero-impressions campaign, since it rules approval in or out in one read.
- **Geo report**: out-of-market cities in the search terms usually mean the radius or Presence setting drifted. **URL not verified** — reach it via in-app nav, then add it to the direct-URL table in `/ad-boost-setup`.
- **Live landing page**: load the provider page with the campaign's exact Final URL and confirm it renders, the UTM lands, and the inquiry CTA works. Clicks paid for a broken page are the worst outcome available and no Google-side report will ever show it.

Do not guess Google Ads URLs. That direct-URL table exists because the in-app nav hides or 404s most of these, and a guessed URL costs a live browser session. Derive once, verify, record.

## Phase 3 — Diagnose

| Symptom | First thing to check | Then |
|---|---|---|
| **Impressions ~0 on an Eligible campaign** | Does it carry the shared negative list, and did the *previous* flight serve on queries that list now blocks? Read the prior flight's search terms at All time | If yes: that is the cause. Detach the list, restore the prior flight's earning keywords, log the tweak. If the prior flight has no such terms: `/ad-boost-audit` |
| High lost IS (rank) everywhere | This is the account baseline — 72–89% on every home-care campaign that has ever served, 77.8% account-wide. It is not a per-campaign fault | Do not reach for negatives. Landing page experience is Below average on 4 of the 5 keywords Google has ever scored; that is the rank drag, and it is a page problem, not a keyword problem |
| Low CTR with named terms that look off-category | Did the campaign that converted have the same pattern? Franchil June's 12.90% CTR — best ever — came from exactly this traffic | Do not negate on sight. If CTR is genuinely collapsing, `/ad-boost-audit` before touching anything |
| "Eligible (Limited) — Missing enough relevant keywords" | Too few live keywords; some drawing 0 impressions | Rebuild from the **previous flight's per-keyword impressions**, never from a template. Franchil Aug was rebuilt from June's zero-impression terms |
| Underspending with lost IS (budget) high | Actually budget-constrained | Leave it. $50 is the locked intro spend |
| Zero leads, clean campaign, clicks landing | Just the $50 math (~0.7 expected leads) | **Nothing.** Do not thrash |
| Clicks but no leads across several flights | Landing page, or the lead arrived and nobody followed up | Read the inquiry threads — `connections` rows for the provider — before blaming the page. Four of four inquiries in program history were read by the provider within a day; one was never answered |
| Disapproved ad / policy | Ad status on `/aw/ads?campaignId=` | Fix the asset. The only case where the ad itself is the cause |

**Mid-flight CTR is a leading indicator, not a verdict.** HomeWell read 1.04% at day 5 and finished the flight at 3.03%. The *waste pattern* in the search terms is the durable signal; CTR recovers on its own sometimes. Harvest on the terms, not on the CTR number.

## Phase 4 — Harvest negatives (the actual work)

Sort every search term into: **provider's own brand** (never negate) · **jobseeker** (negate — the only bucket that is waste by definition) · **out-of-market cities** (negate only if the geo radius is right and the term is genuinely outside it) · **competitor brands** (do **not** negate by default; see the section above) · **adjacent care category** (do **not** negate by default; this is where Franchil's conversions came from) · **legitimate**.

The old buckets negated the middle two on sight. That is now a logged hypothesis with a review date, not a default.

Rules, all non-negotiable:

- **Always phrase match, never broad.** Broad would kill the live `"home health aide {city}"` keyword.
- **A phrase negative blocks any query containing it.** Negating `"home health"` kills the live `"home health aide {city}"`. Negate the specific variants instead: `"home health care"`, `"home health {city}"`, `"home health agencies"`, and the branded ones.
- **Everything goes at campaign level.** The shared list (`12134249254`, 98 terms) is frozen: do not add to it, do not attach it to anything. A per-campaign negative can be reviewed and reversed against that campaign's own numbers; a shared one changes nine campaigns at once and cannot be attributed.
- **Never negate a term the previous flight got a click on.** Read the prior flight's search terms at All time before writing anything.

**TJ gate:** present the proposed negative list per campaign — grouped by bucket, with the live keywords it was checked against — and get his go before pasting. A wrong phrase negative silently kills a live keyword and you will not notice for days. Everything else in this command is read-only and needs no gate.

Pasting: the negative-keyword box is a `<textarea>`, so the JS native-setter trick works. `material-checkbox` and material-inputs do **not** accept synthetic clicks — use the real chrome-devtools `click` tool with snapshot uids. If a click reports success but nothing changes, check `document.elementFromPoint(x,y)` for a stuck `IPL-PROGRESS-INDICATOR` overlay and fix it with a `navigate_page` reload.

**What does and does not respond to synthetic clicks** (measured 2026-08-14, saves a lot of expensive snapshots):

| Element | Synthetic `.click()` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `material-fab` (the `+` Add negative keywords) | **works** | On a campaign with no campaign-level negatives yet the control is a FAB, not a labeled button — search by `aria-label`, not text |
| `material-button` labelled Save / Cancel | **works** | |
| `material-expansionpanel` header (`div.header.closed`) | **fails silently** | Panel stays `closed`. Needs the real `click` tool with a uid |
| `material-checkbox`, material text inputs | **fails** | |

**Typing into material inputs:** JS value setters do not stick. `focus()` → `document.execCommand('selectAll')` → `document.execCommand('insertText', …)` does, and Angular sees it. This is how the CPC cap and the flight end date were both edited.

**The date picker renders on a `<canvas>`** — there are no day cells in the DOM to click, and `innerHTML` for the calendar is empty. Don't try to compute canvas coordinates. There is a plain `<input>` holding the formatted date (e.g. `Aug 16, 2026`) with no aria-label; find it by value and `insertText` the new date (`Aug 30, 2026`), then Save.

**The "Turn off ad blockers" dialog is permanent on this profile** and has no dismiss button. Dia ships a component extension that Google detects, and `--disable-extensions` does not remove it. It does **not** block the negative-keyword or settings work — proceed through it. But it does sometimes leave the Settings panel needing a second attempt: reload, click Settings again, and it renders.

**Watch for the "Unsaved changes" modal.** Editing one settings section and then clicking into another can throw `Your last change wasn't saved. Continue without saving?` — click **Go back**, save the first section, then move on. Save one section at a time and re-verify after a full page reload; the panel will happily show a value that never persisted.

## Phase 5 — Write the numbers back (do NOT skip — this is half the value)

Every metric read in Phase 2 has a real column. **Reading Google and not writing back is the single most wasteful thing this command can do**, because those columns are load-bearing:

| Column | What it drives |
|---|---|
| `ad_clicks`, `ad_impressions` | The CLICKS column in `/admin/ad-boost` — which reads `ad_clicks ?? ad_landings ?? 0`, so a number there does **not** mean Google data is stored; it may be our own UTM-cookie landings. Also the provider receipt (`lib/ad-boost/receipts.server.ts`) |
| `ad_spend_cents` | Receipt spend line; wrap-up and end-of-flight emails |
| `ad_clicks` / `ad_spend_cents` > 0 | **Makes the traction email eligible.** `lib/ad-boost/admin-communications.ts` gates it on exactly this. **Check `provider_comms_paused_at` first** — a campaign under experiment has provider email paused (migration 204) and must not be told it has traction until the review says it does |
| `flight_start_date`, `flight_end_date` | Days-in-flight for the next sweep's prioritization; auto-end scheduler |

Write via **`POST /api/admin/ad-boost`** (the route exports GET, POST, DELETE — **there is no PATCH handler**, a PATCH 405s) or the `/admin/ad-boost` UI. **Cents, not dollars** — $33.02 is `3302`.

Body rules the route enforces, all of which 400 if you get them wrong:

- `ad_budget_cents` and `ad_budget_type` **must be sent together** (or both cleared). Valid types are **`daily`** and **`lifetime`** only — a campaign-total budget is `lifetime`; Rosemonte-style daily budgets are `daily` (`$3.57/day` ⇒ `357`).
- `flight_start_date` must be ≤ `flight_end_date`, evaluated against whatever the row already holds for the field you don't send.
- `id` is required and the write is one row per call.

**Authentication:** the route needs an admin session, and the automation browser profile is usually signed into Google but *not* into olera.care. Check with `fetch('/api/admin/ad-boost')` from the page early — a `401 {"error":"Not authenticated"}` means TJ has to sign in in that window before any of this works. Do that check at Phase 0, not after the whole read is done.

**Backfill `flight_start_date` whenever it is null** while you are already writing. As of the 2026-08-14 sweep every live row had it null, forcing dates to be reconstructed from `admin_note` prose.

Then write the narrative to **`ad_campaign_log`**, not `admin_note`:

```
POST /api/admin/ad-boost/case
{ request_id, google_campaign_id, campaign_tag,
  entry_type: "check_in",
  summary: "Sweep: 47 terms read · CTR 3.03% · avg CPC $2.36",
  detail: "...visibility ratio, what was and was not negated, and why...",
  metrics_snapshot: { impressions, clicks, ctr, cost, lost_is_rank, lost_is_budget } }
```

Any negative added is a **separate `tweak` entry** with `before_state`/`after_state`, an `expected_signal`, and `review_after` 48h out. The route and a DB CHECK both reject a tweak without those. `admin_note` is legacy — it is one text blob that was written at setup and never updated, which is how two months of per-campaign facts went unconnected. Read it for history; do not write to it.

Keep the split clean: **numbers go in columns, narrative goes in the note.** The note explains what was done and why; it should not be the only place a metric exists. **Record final numbers before any revive** — flight 1 and flight 2 blend inside a revived campaign and become unseparable.

## Phase 6 — Flights that are ending

A flight at its end date does **not** get optimized. It gets:

1. A final search-terms harvest at **All time** — those terms are the entire input to flight 2.
2. Final numbers written to the **columns** (`ad_clicks`, `ad_impressions`, `ad_spend_cents`) per Phase 5, plus a closing `admin_note` line. The end-of-flight receipt and wrap-up email read the columns; if they are null the provider gets a receipt with blanks in it.
3. Wrap-up recorded so the outcome flow can ask the provider what actually happened. We are otherwise blind to conversions (see `project_adboost_outcome_blindness`: Franchil spent $36.50 and produced 1 confirmed client the platform never saw).

If the provider has requested again, **do not build a new campaign** — go to `/ad-boost-setup` Phase 3.6 and revive. Quality Score and ad history are per-campaign, and QS is exactly what throttles these campaigns; a fresh build throws it away and restarts learning.

## Output — one readout, not a click narration

**Sweep mode** — a single table across the whole book:

| Provider | Days in flight | Clicks / Impr / CTR | Spend | Verdict | Action taken | Needs TJ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then a short list of anything that needs a decision (keyword rebuilds pending the 48h re-read, providers to ask for photos, flights to revive) and, separately, **any campaign that warrants a targeted run** and why.

**Targeted mode** — no table, one campaign explained: the numbers, the diagnosis and what ruled out the alternatives, what changed, what to re-read and when. If the answer is "nothing is wrong," say that plainly and show the numbers that prove it.

Either mode: do not report a campaign as "optimized" if the only finding was zero leads on clean traffic. Say "healthy, no action, $50 math" and move on.
