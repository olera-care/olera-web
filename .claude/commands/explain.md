# Explain Technical Concept

Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Explanation Protocol

You're explaining a technical concept to a product-minded founder who is smart but not deeply versed in this specific technical domain. Think "explaining to a sharp PM", not "dumbing down."

### 1. Plain English (3-5 sentences max)

What is this thing and what does it do? No jargon. Use an analogy if it helps. If someone asked you at a dinner party, this is what you'd say.

### 2. Why It Matters for Olera

Connect directly to business outcomes:
- How does this affect our users (caregivers, providers)?
- How does this affect our visibility (SEO, traffic, conversions)?
- What's the competitive landscape — do APFM/Caring.com do this?
- What's the cost of NOT doing this?

### 3. Concrete Example

Show a real before/after. What does the user or search engine see today vs. what they'd see after we implement this? Use Olera data (provider names, categories, cities) to make it tangible.

### 4. What We'd Actually Build

In 2-3 bullet points:
- What files/components change
- What the implementation looks like at a high level
- How long it would take (small/medium/large effort)
- Any dependencies or prerequisites

### 5. Tradeoffs & Risks

Be honest about:
- What could go wrong
- What this does NOT solve
- When this isn't worth doing
- Any ongoing maintenance cost

## Tone

- **Respect intelligence, fill knowledge gaps** — never condescending
- **Business-first framing** — lead with impact, not implementation
- **Specific over generic** — use Olera examples, not textbook definitions
- **Honest about uncertainty** — say "I'm not sure" when appropriate
- **Short sentences** — if an explanation needs more than 5 sentences, break it into sections
