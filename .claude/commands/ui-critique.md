# UI/UX Critique

Analyze a screenshot and suggest visual/UX improvements.

Screenshot: $ARGUMENTS

## Design Philosophy

Olera's visual identity should capture:
- **Airbnb**: Clean, spacious, trustworthy, photography-forward, user-friendliness and thoughtfulness
- **Apple**: Simplicity, precision, restraint
- **Claude**: Warm, calm, sophisticated, thoughtful use of whitespace, product value
- **The Browser Company**: UX innovation, delightful interactions
- **Telegram/Revolut**: Responsiveness and animations
- **Linear/Notion/Luma**: Modern but simple and elegant
- **Robinhood**: Approachable UX for complex decisions
- **Instagram**: Visual-first, scroll-stopping design
- **Modern simplicity**: Nothing unnecessary, every element earns its place
- **Elegant restraint**: Premium feel without being flashy or corporate

The goal is an interface that feels calm and reassuring (important for senior care) while being modern and trustworthy. Think "boutique hotel" not "hospital" or "insurance company".

Note: The screenshot is for content/layout reference - focus suggestions on styling and visual treatment.

## Core Design Values

Every critique should evaluate through these lenses:
- **Anticipate needs**: Does the UI predict what the user wants next? Does it surface the right information at the right time?
- **Reduce friction**: Is there anything unnecessary between the user and their goal? Can we remove a step, a click, a moment of confusion?
- **Exceed expectations**: Does this feel generic, or does it have a thoughtful touch that makes the user feel cared for?

## Analysis Framework

### 1. First Impressions (3-second test)
- What draws the eye first?
- Is the hierarchy clear?
- Does it feel cluttered or balanced?

### 2. Visual Design
- **Spacing**: Is there consistent padding/margins? Does it feel cramped or too sparse?
- **Typography**: Is the hierarchy clear? Are text sizes appropriate?
- **Colors**: Good contrast? Consistent with Olera's palette (teal accent, warm backgrounds)?
- **Alignment**: Are elements properly aligned? Any visual tension?
- **Do you see any way we can improve the UI/visuals here?**

### 3. UX Evaluation
- Before we write any code, do you see any way we can thoughtfully improve the UX here?
- Does the layout anticipate what the user needs to decide?
- Is there unnecessary friction between the user and their goal?
- Does the experience exceed expectations or feel generic?

### 4. Olera-Specific
- Matches the "calm, premium, Airbnb-simple" aesthetic?
- Appropriate use of cards/surfaces?
- Does it communicate trust and warmth for the senior care context?

### 5. Accessibility
- Sufficient color contrast?
- Would it work in Dark Mode?
- Text readable at default sizes?

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **What's Working** - Don't just criticize, note what's good
2. **Suggested Improvements** - Prioritized list with specific, actionable changes
3. **Quick Wins** - Small changes with big impact
4. **Optional Enhancements** - Nice-to-haves if time permits

Be specific. Instead of "improve spacing", say "Add 16pt padding between the cards".

Ask the user for their thoughts too - they mentioned having ideas.
