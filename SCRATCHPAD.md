## Session Log

### 2026-02-05

**Supabase Unification - Phase 1 Implementation:**

*Session 2:*
- Connected web app to iOS Supabase (`ocaabzfiiikjcgqwhbwr`)
- Created `lib/types/provider.ts` - iOS Provider schema + helpers
- Key decision: **No adapter layer** - adjusted web to match iOS schema directly
  - User feedback: "why adapter layer, what if we made both uniform"
  - Result: Simpler code, direct schema match
- Updated `app/provider/[slug]/page.tsx`:
  - Queries `olera-providers` table (39,355+ providers)
  - Uses `provider_id` as URL slug
  - Falls back to mock data for dev/demo
- Updated `app/page.tsx`:
  - "Top providers" fetches from Supabase (rating >= 4.0)
  - "Browse by care type" fetches by `provider_category`
  - Added loading skeletons and mock fallback
- Created helper functions:
  - `toCardFormat()` - iOS Provider → ProviderCard data
  - `mockToCardFormat()` - Mock data → ProviderCard data
  - `parseProviderImages()` - Pipe-separated string → array
  - `formatPriceRange()`, `formatLocation()`, `getCategoryDisplayName()`

*Session 3:*
- Updated browse page (`/browse`) to use iOS Supabase
  - Search by name, city, or zipcode
  - Filter by care type (maps to `provider_category`)
  - Filter by state
  - Shows 50 providers, ordered by rating
- Added similar providers to detail page (`/provider/[slug]`)
  - Queries providers with same category
  - Shows up to 4 similar providers with thumbnails
  - Links to browse page for full category view
- **Phase 1 Complete** - All web pages connected to iOS Supabase

**Phase 1 Summary:**
- Provider detail, homepage, browse page all fetch from iOS Supabase
- 39,355+ real providers accessible
- Graceful mock fallback for development
- No schema changes made (iOS app safe during review)

*Session 1:*
- Ran `/explore` workflow - identified TJ's P1 task from Notion
- Explored codebase structure
- Created implementation plan: `plans/supabase-unification-plan.md`
- Constraint: iOS app in Apple review, cannot be broken

**Key Finding:**
- `DATABASE_STRATEGY.md` recommends Neon + Clerk, but Notion task specifies Supabase unification
- Decision: Follow Notion task, keep DATABASE_STRATEGY.md as future reference

### 2026-02-03

**Hero Section Redesign:**
- Added HousingAnywhere-inspired pill-style search bar (location + care type inputs)
- Added social proof pill above headline ("48,000+ verified providers listed")
- Added background image with overlay for readability
- Changed headline to sentence case ("Find the right care for your loved one")

**Provider Card Spacing Fixes:**
- Set image section to 256px (`h-64`)
- Set content section to 256px (`h-64`) - total card height now 512px
- Standardized vertical stacks:
  - Stack 1: Category (caps) → Provider Name → Location
  - Stack 2: Pricing + Reviews
  - Stack 3: Highlights (anchored to bottom with `mt-auto`)
  - Stack 4 (hover): Accepted Payments (animates in using CSS grid `grid-rows-[0fr]` to `grid-rows-[1fr]`)
- Fixed tooltip z-index issues (badge tooltip now `z-30`, payment tooltip `z-50`)
- Fixed overflow clipping on payment tooltip with `overflow-hidden group-hover:overflow-visible`

**Files Changed:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Hero section, card wrapper height
- `components/providers/ProviderCard.tsx` - Card structure and spacing
- Set up Notion MCP integration for Claude Code (user-scoped)
- Updated `/explore` command to fetch tasks from "Web App Action Items/Roadmap" Notion database
- Added Step 0: Identify team member (TJ, Logan, Esther) and auto-fetch their highest priority "To Do" task
- Correct data_source_id: `2f75903a-0ffe-8166-9d6f-000b1b51cb11`
- Files modified: `.claude/commands/explore.md`

### 2026-02-02

- Added "Top providers near you" section to homepage with 4 provider cards
- Created `ProviderCard` component (`components/providers/ProviderCard.tsx`)
- Created provider detail page (`app/provider/[slug]/page.tsx`) with hero, about, amenities, and contact card
- Using dummy data for providers (will connect to Supabase later)

### 2026-01-30

- Set up Claude GitHub App for olera-care organization
- Created slash commands: `/resume`, `/explore`, `/plan`, `/commit`, `/save`, `/quicksave`, `/troubleshoot`, `/postmortem`, `/ui-critique`, `/compact`
- Created SCRATCHPAD.md
