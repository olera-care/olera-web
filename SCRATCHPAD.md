## Current Focus

### 2026-04-29 — Post-answer hook P1 + dashboard hero overhaul — all merged to staging

Massive day. 6 PRs merged to staging in sequence. Architecture pivoted twice based on TJ feedback. Hero is now a fully dynamic, photo-driven, 6-tier priority surface with per-section imagery and skeleton loading.

**PR #676 — `60bab22c`.** Smart picker folded into existing DashboardHero as 6-tier priority stack:
1. Fresh leads → "View inquiries" (engagement, leads supersede questions per TJ)
2. Unanswered Qs → "Review questions" (engagement)
3. View spike ≥25% → no CTA (positive reinforcement)
4. Views ≥ 10 + incomplete → engagement headline + section-specific CTA
5. Views < 10 + incomplete → section-specific completion pick (full headline)
6. Views < 10 + complete → "Your page is live" fallback (no CTA)

Engagement-tier CTAs (1-3) navigate via `<Link>`; completion-tier CTAs (4-5) fire `provider_picker_clicked` with `metadata.source: "hero"` and open the relevant edit modal in place. Pre-test caught one phantom-impression race — fixed by reading localStorage in `useState` initializer. [Notion merge report](https://app.notion.com/p/3515903a0ffe8187b714d2d097cbcf42).

**PR #679 — `3df7442e`.** Post-answer hook on `/provider/[slug]/onboard`. After 4/10 self-assessment of the picker-on-success-state approach (4 stacked cards), pivoted to **auto-redirect**: brief 400ms "✓ Response sent" pulse → `router.push("/provider?from=qa-success")` → dashboard hero handles next-action from there. Pure subtraction — deleted `PostAnswerPicker.tsx`, `SmartNextActionCard.tsx`, simplified ActionCard + DashboardPage. Funnel sharpened: dropped `picker_qa_success_clickers` bucket, added `qa_success_arrivals` column backed by new `dashboard_arrival` event. Diagnostic: separates "did redirect work?" from "did hero nudge action?" Bug shipped to staging then fixed (`9731698a`): redirect was via `useEffect` on `submitted`, but `onSubmitted` flipped parent's `questionAnswered`, the `{!questionAnswered && (...)}` conditional collapsed children, React's reconciler unmounted `InlineQuestionResponse`, useEffect cleanup killed the timer. Fix: moved `setTimeout` into submit handler closure (timer survives unmount; `router` from `useRouter` is stable global). [Notion merge report](https://app.notion.com/p/3515903a0ffe8108ae80f54e70d04ce4).

**PR #683 — `614d0738`.** Hotfix: `/api/provider/dashboard` resolved wrong profile for multi-profile accounts. Query did `.eq("account_id", id) .in("type", [org, caregiver]) .limit(1)` with no ORDER BY — Postgres returned rows in unspecified order. With TJ's account having both Aggie + a `[TEST]` profile, dashboard rendered Aggie's "4 inquiries" hero on the test profile. Fix: query by `account.active_profile_id` first, fall back to limit(1) for legacy accounts. Same anti-pattern in ~14 other endpoints (review-requests, care-post/*, medjobs/*, etc.) — flagged in commit message, latent until multi-profile becomes a real flow.

**PR #685 + #686 — `b0a78dae` + `30256cba`.** Per-tier and per-section hero images. 11 unique 1920×1080 images sourced via Pexels/Unsplash:
- Tier 1: `dashboard-hero-leads.jpg`
- Tier 2: `dashboard-hero-questions.jpg`
- Tier 3: `dashboard-hero-spike.jpg`
- Tier 4 + 5: section-specific (gallery, about, pricing, services, screening, payment, overview)
- Tier 6: `dashboard-hero-fallback.jpg`

Visual mood matches the ask — gallery prompt gets a community/photographer image, leads get an active inquiry image, etc. `imageUrl` field on `Hook` interface; `hook.imageUrl ?? HERO_IMAGE_DEFAULT` fallback. Image hunt spec saved at `docs/hero-image-hunt.md` for future hunts.

**PR #687 — `91ec835f`.** De-jank: hero used to wait ~500ms for V2 fetch with empty slot, then pop in causing layout shift. Fixed three ways: (a) inline `DashboardHeroSkeleton` reserves identical dimensions (no layout shift on swap), (b) "Hey {firstName}" greeting renders immediately during skeleton (we have it from auth context — partial-content load, not pure shimmer), (c) all 11 tier images preloaded on mount via `new Image()` so tier swaps during the session are instant from cache. Dropped the misplaced top-level `DashboardPillarsSkeleton` (62 lines removed) — it was rendered above the page header, causing a double layout shift TJ wasn't even seeing.

**PR #688 — Slack alerts + daily digest extension.** Three new alerts: 🎯 dashboard arrival (qa-success only), ✋ hero CTA click, ✅ profile edit. Daily digest gains a 3rd Providers row covering same chain. `slackHeroCtaClicked` + `slackDashboardArrival` + `slackProfileEdited` helpers in `lib/slack.ts`. Wired through activity-track route. Daily digest extended in `app/api/cron/daily-digest/route.ts`.

**PR #690 — engagement-tier click tracking.** TJ caught on prod that clicking Aggie's leads banner (Tier 1) didn't fire a Slack alert. Original tracking only covered completion-tier (section pickers). Engagement-tier `<Link>` CTAs were navigations with no event handler. Fix: added `engagementTier?: "leads" | "questions"` to `NavCta`, fire `provider_picker_clicked` from Link onClick with metadata.tier + metadata.destination. `slackHeroCtaClicked` extended to render engagement shape ("Going to: Inquiries (/provider/connections)") OR completion shape ("Opening section: Gallery") based on which fields are present. PR #691 — cosmetic tooltip update on /admin/analytics to reflect that the "Clicked dashboard" hero bucket now covers both engagement + completion tiers.

**Test infrastructure used + cleaned up:**
- Created `[TEST] Empty State Provider` (Tier 5 — gallery completion pick, place-based memory care) — TJ screenshot grabbed, deleted.
- Created `[TEST] Questions State Provider` with 3 unanswered questions (Tier 2 — questions hero) — TJ screenshot grabbed, deleted.
- Created `[TEST] Completion State Provider` (memory care, place-based) — TJ screenshot grabbed, deleted.
- TJ's `active_profile_id` restored to Aggie (`d4242723-f94b-4c3a-92c3-dc65ad44e72a`).
- Three distinct hero visual states captured for team demo (leads / questions / completion).

**🚨 PR #693 — CRITICAL silent-failure bug + hotfix.** After staging→main promote, TJ noticed engagement-tier hero clicks were producing no Slack alerts. Diagnostic: ZERO rows in `provider_activity` for any of the four new event types (`provider_picker_impression`, `provider_picker_clicked`, `provider_profile_edited`, `dashboard_arrival`) across the entire history. Root cause: PRs #676 / #679 / #688 / #690 added the events to the application allowlist but **NEVER added a migration to extend the DB CHECK constraint** on `provider_activity.event_type`. Every insert failed silently — route's fire-and-forget client `.catch(() => {})` swallowed the rejection. Memory `feedback_schema_text_not_enum.md` (43 days old) literally documented this pattern. I had it but didn't apply it. **Detection latency: ~7 hours. Resolution latency: ~30 min.** Migration `055_post_answer_engagement_event_types.sql` extends the constraint. TJ applied via Supabase dashboard SQL editor; events started landing immediately, Slack alerts began firing on real engagement.

**PR #694 — postmortem.** Documented in `docs/POSTMORTEMS.md`. New memory `feedback_event_allowlist_needs_db_migration.md` saved (sharper guidance than the 43-day-old one — leads with the specific reflex `grep -rn "provider_activity_event_type_check" supabase/migrations/` whenever adding event types).

**Notion tasks created:**
- [Mobile-optimize provider portal: drop card containers on phones](https://app.notion.com/p/3515903a0ffe81baa949f4e34b5ebfb8) — P2, triple-nesting wastes horizontal real estate on mobile
- [Hero image library: per-tier asset hunt + wiring](https://app.notion.com/p/3515903a0ffe81709c0eef2b1bf74cee) — P3, completed (all 11 images sourced)

**Memories saved (4 project dirs):**
- `feedback_default_to_now_not_later.md` in olera-web, olera-hq, TJ-hq, olera-expansion-map. TJ called out the "save it for later" reflex as outdated — AI-paired dev inverts the cost calculus.
- `feedback_event_allowlist_needs_db_migration.md` in olera-web. Sharper guidance for adding event types, born from the 7h silent-failure incident.

**Live on main:** all of today's work has been promoted (staging → main multiple times). All 4 new event types now logging + Slack alerts firing + funnel columns incrementing.

**Still open:**
- Mobile container cleanup (separate P2)
- Image preload could be optimized (currently 1.6MB on mount; lazy load per-tier on demand would be lighter but needs more code)
- ~14 other endpoints share the `account_id + .limit(1)` anti-pattern — latent until multi-profile becomes a real flow

### 2026-04-28 — Post-answer hook + smart picker (P1) — planned, not started

Three-PR sequence to capture peak engagement at the post-answer moment and redirect providers into the V2 dashboard. Plan: [`plans/post-answer-hook-and-smart-picker-plan.md`](plans/post-answer-hook-and-smart-picker-plan.md). Notion: [P1 task](https://www.notion.so/Hook-the-post-answer-moment-lure-providers-into-the-V2-profile-edit-dashboard-34e5903a0ffe818eb372fb6539e65391).

Discovery confirmed: the answer form already lives on `/provider/[slug]/onboard` (`ActionCard.tsx`), so this is a success-state UI swap, not an architecture rebuild. Esther confirmed the verification gate on answer publication is intentional — keep it, monitor. Smart picker is a single component shared between the post-answer surface and the dashboard's existing static 30%-banner (which gets upgraded in the same work).

- **PR A (funnel instrumentation, ships first):** extend `qa_funnel` rollup with `clicked_dashboard` (reads existing `analytics_teaser_cta_clicked` events) + `edited_profile` columns on `/admin/analytics`. Baseline before any UI ships.
- **PR B (smart picker on dashboard):** new `<SmartNextActionCard>` + `lib/next-best-action.ts` scoring function. Replaces the static "Complete your profile" banner on `DashboardPage.tsx`. Category-aware soft-honest copy (no data-claim multipliers).
- **PR C (post-answer hook):** swap the `if (submitted)` branch in `ActionCard.tsx` for the same picker with `source="qa-success"`. Source-tagged links + per-source funnel attribution.

### 2026-04-28 — Restore category stock-image fallback (P2) — shipped to staging via PR #670

**[PR #670](https://github.com/olera-care/olera-web/pull/670)** on branch `feat/provider-stock-image-fallback`. Two commits:

1. **`8a5b488b`** — empty-array fix. Wired `getCategoryFallbackImage` into the provider detail hero (`app/provider/[slug]/page.tsx`) and fixed `businessProfileToCardFormat` so `imageType: "photo"` for stock URLs (was `"placeholder"`, short-circuiting three card components to gradient). Helper + 15-image library at `public/images/fallback/` had existed since `d4ffa24a` but was never wired to the V2 hero. TJ verified the photoless case works on staging across all 6 in-scope categories.

2. **`17ce40cf`** — runtime-failure extension (TJ asked to keep the extension on the same PR to avoid context fragmentation). TJ found a second case via DevTools: providers WITH image URLs that 502 through next/image (R2 / cdn-api hosts on staging) still showed gradient. The carousel cycled "1/6 → 1/5 → ... → 1/1 → gradient" as each onError fired. Fix: new `fallbackImage` prop on `ProviderHeroGallery` and new `fallbackImage` field on `ProviderCardData`. When `validImages.length === 0` (whether from empty array OR runtime onError cascade) the gallery now renders the stock photo, not the gradient. Same fallback path added to all three browse-card components. Verified working on Visiting Angels + Choice Home Care detail pages, plus Comfort Keepers / Visiting Angels browse cards.

3. **`217a2f7a`** — polish (TJ flagged "a little bit of jank" — the counter cycling "1/6 → 1/5 → ..." was still visible during the onError cascade even though the end state was correct). Render-stack approach: stock photo as a base layer (z-0) always rendered when fallback available; real image(s) as overlay (z-1). While real image is loading it's transparent, so the stock shows through — no flash. Once real image loads, it covers stock. If it fails, stock stays. Gallery's counter + arrows now gated on `anyRealImageLoaded` — only appear once a real image confirms `onLoad`, hiding the cycling visibility entirely. Same pattern applied to all three browse-card components (`BrowsePageClient`, `BrowseCard`, `ProviderCard`).

**Diff: 8 files, +258 / -110.** Build clean (3795/3795), typecheck 0 errors. Pre-test review traced 18 vectors — no bugs.

**Categories in scope:** 6 (Home Care Non-medical, Home Health Care, Assisted Living, Independent Living, Memory Care, Nursing Home). Two home-care types share the home-care pool. Artifact categories (hospice/rehab/adult day care/wellness/private caregiver) fall through to home-care imagery via `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_POOL` — separate cleanup project per TJ.

**Underlying root cause** (not addressed in this PR): some real provider image URLs are 502'ing through Vercel's `/next/image` optimizer on staging — could be stale R2 URLs, image-domain config, or a transient. Worth its own investigation; this PR makes the symptom invisible.

**Next:** TJ to re-verify the polish commit on staging (counter "1/6 → 1/1" cycle should no longer be visible on detail pages with broken images), then merge to main via `/pr-merge`.

### 2026-04-28 — Benefits QA queue populated for all 49 remaining states

Bulk-populated the [Benefits QA — Program Review Queue](https://www.notion.so/fb03b87a9918460086ae728ee879b9e2) Notion DB with **614 program rows** across all states with completed pipeline data (FL + TX were already there). Queue now has 626 total rows. Cess can filter by State and work through states one at a time; the high-severity rows (62 across 49 states) are the priority since they're real numeric mismatches >15% from a fresh source check.

**Approach:** built `scripts/build-qa-rows.js` to assemble row data from `data/pipeline/{STATE}/{classify,drafts,factcheck}.json`, derive Severity from flag list, format flag fields as readable summaries. Split into 100-page batches and delegated insertion to a subagent (the MCP `notion-create-pages` payload was too large to inline). One typo introduced in a Wyoming source URL (`Database` → `Department`) caught and corrected via update-page.

**Flag totals across 49 new states:** 161 programs flagged, 62 high-severity, 99 medium. Most medium flags are phone mismatches where pipeline drafted local numbers and verifier returned a national hotline — judgment calls, not defects.

### 2026-04-28 — Benefits intake conversion lift (P1) — planned, not started

Three-PR sequence to lift visit→started + started→completed on the embedded benefits intake on provider pages. Plan: [`plans/benefits-intake-conversion-lift-plan.md`](plans/benefits-intake-conversion-lift-plan.md). Notion: [P1 task](https://www.notion.so/Improve-benefits-intake-conversion-copy-visual-treatment-to-lift-completion-rate-34e5903a0ffe813aa547d2cc4378e761).

Audit of all 5 steps showed only the **save step** has fat to trim (the others are clean). Resequenced to fix that first — instrumenting before the redesign would give us a week of baseline data on a form we're about to change.

- **PR A (save-step rework, ships first):** drop name field; cut redundant "We found programs for your family." H2 (eyebrow + button already carry the proof); drop pointless "1 ·" / "2 ·" field-label numbering (one field doesn't need a counter). Backend tolerates missing firstName via existing `display_name: "Care Seeker"` fallback. Single-field forms convert dramatically better than multi-field — likely 10-25% lift on its own.
- **PR B (per-step instrumentation, after PR A stable):** new `/api/benefits/track-step` route + `useTrackStep` helper; fires `benefits_entry_viewed`, `benefits_step_viewed`, `benefits_step_completed` to `provider_activity`. All carry a `variant` field (forced to `"control"` in PR B). No Slack pings on the new events. Watch ~1 week before PR C.
- **PR C (entry-point copy A/B + trust strip, after PR B watch):** deterministic 50/50 hash on `session_id` (no GrowthBook installed); money-loss headline + dynamic-state sub-line on the variant arm; trust strip on **both** arms. Decision rule: 20%+ lift → ship; <5% movement → kill and look downstream.
- **Scope:** ONLY `BenefitsDiscoveryModule` (the embedded 5-step entry on provider pages). Standalone `BenefitsIntakeForm` out of scope.

### 2026-04-27 — Sweep #1 (provider data-quality cleanup) shipped

End-to-end provider directory cleanup. Started with 73,304 active providers, ended with 70,722 — net 2,582 deletes + 270 reclassifications.

**Approach evolution (regex iteration → LLM self-correction):**
- v1 (sweep day): regex amnesia detector caught 320 amnesia cases (199 reclass-eligible).
- v2.0–v2.2 (this morning): widened regex 4x to catch ThedaCare-style long-list-negation FPs, Lexie Rae-style "residential care facility" FNs, Joyful-style definitional-context confusions. Reached 245 reclass / 2,569 deletions.
- **Final: scrapped regex.** Did a focused LLM re-pass (4.1 min, ~$5) on the 2,936 OUT_OF_SCOPE verdicts with a forced-choice anti-amnesia prompt. 354 recovered (271 reclass / 83 silent), 2,582 confirmed deletions. Replaced regex output with this.
- **Disagreement file:** generated alongside (regex v2.2 vs re-pass) — 233 cases where the two signals diverged. Useful sanity-check artifact for TJ's spot-check.

**Total cost: ~$170** ($0 Tier 1 + $3 calibration + $160 Phase 3 LLM verify + $5 LLM re-pass + $2 retries).

**Files in this PR (`feat/data-sweep-skill` off staging):**
- `docs/provider-category-definitions.md` (NEW) — 6-category source of truth, with state-specific terms (RCFE, PCH, AFH).
- `docs/data-sweep-runbook.md` (NEW) — operational details: Tier 1 regex, inverted Phase 3 prompt, contradiction detection logic, MD format, cost expectations, change log.
- `.claude/commands/data-sweep.md` (NEW) — slash command / skill for future sweeps.
- `scripts/pipeline-batch.js` — three Stream A prompts now share the new `SIX_CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS` + `OUT_OF_SCOPE_TYPES` constants. Tight YES list (the 6) + comprehensive NO list. Stream B Places call now also fetches `types`/`businessStatus`/`addressComponents` (stored in `google_reviews_data` for future filter logic).
- `scripts/discovery-batch.py` — search terms tightened: removed '55+', 'senior apartments', 'rehabilitation center', 'cognitive care', 'memory support', 'visiting nurse' (alone), and other contamination sources. New comment block documents the rationale.

**Backups for revert (in `~/Desktop/TJ-hq/Olera/Provider Database/Cleanup/`):**
- `deletions-executed-2026-04-27.csv` (2,582 rows: provider_id, name, current_category, city, state)
- `reclassifications-executed-2026-04-27.csv` (270 rows: provider_id, name, old_category, new_category, city, state)
- All MD versions kept: `*.v1.md`, `*.v2-regex.md`, current files = LLM re-pass output.

**Key learnings → runbook for sweep #2:**
- Free-text LLM reasoning + regex parsing = compounding fragility. Default to forced-choice prompts when possible.
- Whenever you find yourself patching regex 5+ times, step back and ask if the approach is wrong.
- LLM re-pass with anti-amnesia prompt gives structured output for ~$5; replaces regex post-processing entirely.
- Some patterns regex still catches that LLM misses, and vice versa — disagreement file surfaces these for human triage.

**Next steps after this PR merges:**
- Phase 7 reflection (already in runbook — formalize once we run sweep #2).
- Wrong-category cleanup of INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE providers (~50K) — would need different prompt + signal.
- Backfill `google_reviews_data.{places_types, business_status, country_code}` for existing providers (separate workstream).
- Migrate the 13-type backend ProfileCategory enum to match the 6 (longer-term cleanup).

### 2026-04-27 EOD — Phase 2 A/B live in prod, Phase 3 picked up tomorrow

Four PRs shipped in one day across Phase 1 + Phase 2:
- PR #648 / #651 — Phase 1 funnel visibility on `/admin/analytics`
- PR #653 — Phase 2 A/B variant assignment + admin split table
- PR #658 — Phase 2 to prod (bundled with Cess's FL editorial)
- PR #659 / #661 — visibility fix so the A/B table renders before first send

Slack [addendum thread](https://oleraworkspace.slack.com/archives/C0A91BA205T/p1777334076195659?thread_ts=1777319720.741329) live in `#ai-product-development` to inform the team.

Resuming tomorrow: Phase 3 (follow-ups for unopened — biggest open-rate lever per audit). Notion task ([Phase 3 Resume-here pre-flight](https://www.notion.so/34f5903a0ffe81809188d977573d27d2)) updated with file paths, sequence priority, and the Phase 2 dependency note. Pre-flight summary:
- All infra in place: cron route just needs to be added at `app/api/cron/qa-email-followups/route.ts` + `vercel.json` cron entry
- Sequence #1 (24h unopened resend) ships first; #2 (channel switch via Twilio/Slack) and #3 (6h opened-not-clicked nudge) are follow-ups
- Earliest clean ship date: 2026-05-04 (lets Phase 2 A/B accumulate ~1 week of un-tainted signal). Or accept noise and run concurrently — velocity call

### 2026-04-27 — Q&A email A/B test on subject + preheader (Phase 2 of P1) — PR #653

**Status:** shipped to staging via PR #653, promoted to main via PR #658. Visibility fix shipped via PR #659/#661. Notion task moved to In Progress/Doing — awaiting 2-3 weeks of A/B data.

Started Phase 2 ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/34f5903a0ffe81dc8d6fd39cdb40fe23)) the same day Phase 1 shipped — startup velocity, no point waiting for clean baseline data to start iterating on copy. First commit was a tame "for"-instead-of-"about" subject + preheader = question excerpt. TJ pushed back twice: (1) PHI concern on asker name in subject, (2) "we can do way better, do research." Refolded into a real A/B with research-backed B variant.

**Variants:**
- A (control) — exact production: `A family has a question about {Provider}`, no preheader
- B — the question text itself, quote-wrapped, truncated 48 chars: `"Can residents bring their own furniture?"` + preheader `From a family on Olera · {Provider}`
- B PHI-fallback — when question text matches `/(dementi|alzheim|parkinson|cancer|stroke|hospice|als|dialysis|...)/i`, fall back to `A new family question for {Provider}` + generic preheader

**Why this B:** B2B subject-line research (2026 benchmarks, Apollo/Prospeo/Campaign Monitor) shows question-format subjects average ~46% open vs ~32% for statements; short subjects (≤4 words) lift opens 45%; marketing-urgency language drops opens below 36% and 69% of decision-makers report being annoyed by it. The format that wins is "looks like a colleague forwarded a real question" — which is literally what B is.

**Implementation:**
- `lib/email-templates.tsx` — `assignQuestionVariant()` (random 50/50), `questionReceivedInbox()` returns `{subject, preheader, phiFiltered}`, PHI keyword regex
- 3 send sites (live + 2 deferred) use the same helper, persist `variant` + `phi_filtered` to `email_log.metadata`
- `app/api/admin/analytics/summary/route.ts` — `qa_funnel_by_variant` rollup added; reads `metadata.variant` from each `email_log` row
- `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` — new `<VariantSplit>` table inside Q&A funnel card, shows per-variant sent/delivered/opened/clicked + open rate + CTR. Hidden until variant data exists. Footnote when pre-deploy emails (no variant) appear in the window.

**Volume math:** 70 sends/day ÷ 2 arms = 35/arm/day. Directional signal in 2-3 weeks; statistical significance in 6-8 weeks. Ship the directional winner without waiting for p<0.05.

**Memory:** `feedback_phi_in_subject_lines.md` saved (no asker names / health detail in subjects — server logs, push notifications, lock screens leak).

**Next up:**
- Wait for Vercel green, merge PR #653 → staging
- Then promote staging → main (Q&A funnel admin tile already on main from PR #651, but A/B variants need to flow to prod sends)
- Watch the Variant Split table on /admin/analytics over the next 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 ([follow-ups for unopened](https://www.notion.so/34f5903a0ffe81809188d977573d27d2)) is queued; biggest open-rate lever per audit but blocks on Phase 2 isolation

**Skipped (deliberate):**
- Resend backfill — send-only API key blocks `GET /emails/:id`; cohort self-corrects by 2026-05-03 once 7d window is entirely post-webhook
- Send-time / sender / DMARC audit — flagged for follow-up, not on critical path
- Preheaders on the other 5+ email templates — strict improvement, deferred (infra now in place)

### 2026-04-27 — Production missing V2 dashboard hero — FF removed (PR #647)

**Symptom:** olera.care `/provider` was showing the old "Profile completeness + provider card" layout. Staging had the V2 hero ("34 questions waiting for your answer" orientation banner), prod did not. Slack to Logan/Esther: TJ flagged the gap to avoid duplicate work before resuming the post-care-secret-question optimization.

**Root cause:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROVIDER_ANALYTICS_ONBOARD` env var was set in Vercel staging but not production. Both branches had identical code; the gate at `components/provider-dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx:39-40` and `components/provider-onboarding/ActionCard.tsx:10-11` short-circuited the V2 layout when the flag wasn't `"true"`.

**Fix path chosen:** Path B — rip the flag out (vs Path A flip the env var). V2 has been live on staging since 2026-04-23, no remaining "off" use case. PR #647 open against staging.

**Diff: -202 lines.** Net deletion. Files:
- `components/provider-dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` — flag const + 4 inline references removed; `useProviderDashboardV2Data("30d", true, user?.id)`
- `components/provider-onboarding/ActionCard.tsx` — flag const + both FF-off branches deleted; dead helpers stripped from `ProfilePreviewCard` (`handleReviewsCtaClick`, `reviewsCta`, `reviewsContent`, `snippetText`, `starPath`); `googleReviewSnippet` and `unansweredCount` props dropped

**Validation:** typecheck 0 errors, build clean (3,794 static pages), eslint shows only pre-existing 8 errors on `<a href="/provider/reviews">` (unchanged from staging baseline). Pre-test review found nothing — the V2 path being kept is the same path staging has been running for 4 days.

**Next up:**
- Merge PR #647 staging → main → olera.care redeploys with hero visible
- Then resume the post-answer provider journey optimization (the original Slack thread context: "before optimizing the provider journey from care secret question")
- Reply in `#ai-product-development` once merged so Logan/Esther know the gap is closed

### 2026-04-27 — Q&A email funnel visibility shipped (Phase 1 of P1 task) — PR #648 / #651

**Status:** shipped to staging via PR #648, promoted to main via PR #651. Notion task marked Done 🙌. Phase 2 ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/34f5903a0ffe81dc8d6fd39cdb40fe23)) and Phase 3 ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/34f5903a0ffe81809188d977573d27d2)) split off as sibling tasks.

Audited the P1 task ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe80a3989ee19c09dc110a)). Key finding: the leak is the provider notification email open rate, not anything on the care-seeker side. Last 7d on staging: 520 sent → 36 opens → 27 sign-ins → 19 answered. Once they open, ~58% answer. Once they sign in, we got them.

The visibility gap: we saw opens (existing `qa_email_openers` tile) and downstream sign-ins/answered, but nothing upstream. Sent / delivered / bounced / marked-spam were all captured in `email_events` + denormalized on `email_log` (since 2026-04-26 commit `9b1f74f5`), just not displayed. PR #648 surfaces them as a new "Provider Q&A Email Funnel" card on `/admin/analytics`.

Two-file diff (`app/api/admin/analytics/summary/route.ts` + `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx`). Pre-test review caught one bug pre-ship: cohort vs event anchor mismatch on bounced/complained — fixed by event-anchoring those side stats so they stay in lockstep with the issues list.

Resend backfill skipped: full-access API key required (current key is send-only). Instead, the cohort will fully reconcile by 2026-05-03 once the 7d window is entirely post-webhook. Phase 2 (subject line / preheader / sender rep / send-time) and Phase 3 (follow-ups for unopened) build on this baseline.

Notion task body updated with TARGET METRIC + Phase 1/2/3. Memory `project_qa_funnel.md` saved so future sessions don't re-misread the funnel direction.

### 2026-04-27 — Benefits QA: em-dash cleanup shipped (PR #650), Cess's FL audits surfaced

**PR #650 shipped to staging** — em-dash stragglers + draft prompt hardening.
- Branch: `chore/em-dash-stragglers-cleanup`. 2 commits: `fce38c6c` (9 sites in FL drafts.json + Rule 9 in prompt), `3d6d18e2` (pre-test follow-up: cleaned ~14 prose em dashes from prompt EXEMPLARs/placeholders that were teaching Claude by example).
- Cause of stragglers: prior sweep (`6a0f8c99`) regex matched literal `—` but JSON stores `—` escape form; 9 leaked through in TJ's WAP audit content. Five replaced with comma, 1 period, 2 semicolons, 1 parens (failing roof / active mold / unsafe electrical comma-soup).
- Pre-test review caught Rule 9 contradicting itself via the `applicationNotes` EXEMPLAR (3 em dashes in sample "good" output) + ~10 placeholder descriptions. Fixed in second commit. Icon-menu structural separators (47, "House" — home care) left intentionally; clearly list format, not prose.
- Renderer chain verified: callout text rendered via `String(section.text)` plain, FAQ answers via `<p>{faq.answer}</p>` + JSON-LD schema. Both safe.

**🚨 Critical discovery — Cess has been QA'ing FL programs since 2026-04-22 and her work was invisible to my Notion query.**
- TJ called this out by sharing a screenshot showing 11/14 FL rows with all 5 checkboxes ticked. My API filter (`Status equals Approved/In Progress/Needs Changes/Blocked`) returned only 3 rows because **Cess ticks per-step checkboxes but leaves Status="Not Started" and Reviewer="Open"**.
- 8 Cess-touched FL rows discovered: CCE (1 phone flag), Elder Options, HCE, MoW, Legal Aid, LIHEAP, PACE, SHINE. Audit findings live inside page bodies under "## Audit Results", not on the queue row metadata.
- Read 4 of 8 page bodies so far (CCE/HCE/MoW/PACE). Remaining 4: SHINE, Elder Options, Legal Aid, LIHEAP — fetching next.

**Patterns surfacing in Cess's audits (so far):**
- **Real factual errors:** PACE income `$2,901 → $2,982/mo` (300% FBR 2026, same fix as SMMC-LTC). PACE service-area: page says "Miami-Dade only" but Cess reports "now available in 30+ counties incl. Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Panhandle." CCE phone `211 → 1-800-963-5337` (Elder Helpline).
- **Site-wide bugs (every FL page she touched):** "Related programs" cross-links broken on every program (renderer issue, not content). "Free — no cost to you" header showing on programs that aren't free (HCE has $160/mo subsidy; PACE has private-pay premium for non-Medicaid).
- **Editorial scripts pending:** Full prose rewrites for Overview / Eligibility details / How to apply / Steps / Multiple FAQs across CCE, HCE, MoW, PACE. Substantial.

**Recommended path forward (3-PR split):**
1. Site-wide bug PR — debug "Related programs" cross-link breakage + "Free" header gate. Fixes apply to all 51 states, highest leverage.
2. FL factual corrections PR — PACE income + service area, CCE phone. Small/fast, denial-risk numbers.
3. FL editorial rewrites PR — apply Cess's prose scripts. Bigger, taste-driven, slower review.

**Memory saved:** `feedback_benefits_qa_status_filter.md` — Notion QA queue: Cess ticks checkboxes without changing Status; don't filter by Status alone, query all rows + read page bodies.

**Read all 8 Cess-reviewed FL page bodies. Full audit inventory captured.**

**Chunk 1 shipped — PR #652** `qa/benefits-site-wide-bugs` — three site-wide renderer bugs in `components/waiver-library/ProgramPageV3.tsx` (+31/-20):
- `relatedPrograms` filter: drop unresolvable entries instead of rendering gray non-link pills. Audit showed 1,820 of 2,332 entries (78%) across all 51 states currently render as broken-looking pills because they reference programs not in our pipeline (TANF, SSI, Senior Farmers Market, etc.). Now: section either shows working links or doesn't render at all. Net 2,332 visible pills → 512 working links.
- "Free, no cost to you" hero banner: removed entirely. Was tripping on HCE ($160/mo subsidy), PACE (private-pay premium), Elder Options (sliding-scale co-pay) — promotional rather than editorial. `savingsRange` already handles the truly-free case.
- `useSectionObserver` rewrite: was only reacting to `isIntersecting=true`, leaving active id stuck on prior sections. Now tracks the set of currently-intersecting sections and picks topmost in document order. Fixes the "Eligibility highlighted while at Overview" screenshot Cess sent twice.
- Typecheck clean. Both production routes (`/benefits/[slug]/[program]` + `/senior-benefits/[state]/[benefit]`) use V3; V2 is unimported dead code.

**Chunk 2 shipped — PR #654** `qa/fl-factual-corrections` — 6 denial-risk fact fixes in `data/pipeline/FL/drafts.json` (+drafts.ts auto-regen):
- PACE income $2,901 → **$2,982/mo** (FAQ); same correction we applied to SMMC-LTC.
- PACE service area Miami-Dade only → **30+ counties** (4 sites: localEntities, intro, applicationNotes, FAQ). Page was actively turning away caregivers in 30+ counties.
- CCE top-level phone `null` → **`1-800-963-5337`** (Elder Helpline) + replaced placeholder DOEA contact + filled empty `sourceUrl`.
- Elder Options home equity cap $585,000 → **$752,000** (3 sites: exemptAssets, structuredEligibility.homeEquityCap numeric, FAQ Q1 + spouse-waives-cap nuance added).
- Elder Options service area 5 counties → **16 counties** (4 sites: intro, eligibility requirements, applicationNotes, FAQ Q2). Page was telling caregivers in 11 N.C. FL counties they were out of area when ElderOptions actually serves them.
- LIHEAP "not all Florida counties participate" → **"active in all 67 Florida counties"** + heating cycle (through March 31) + cooling cycle (April 1+).

**Editorial inventory for chunk 3 (still pending):**
- CCE: Overview, "What's Covered" (medication clarity), Eligibility details, Steps, FAQ Q2/3/5/6/7/8
- HCE: Header, Overview ($160/mo subsidy detail), asset/income/medical scripts, How to apply, FAQ Q4
- MoW: Overview ¶2 ($7-9.49/meal pricing), Other Requirements, How to apply, Get in touch contacts, FAQ Q4/5/8
- PACE: Header (already partly handled by chunk 1), Overview, eligibility scripts, Good to Know, Steps, FAQ Q2/Q7
- SHINE: Remove personal staff email, use Elder Helpline + floridashine.org Find-a-Site
- Elder Options: 16-county throughout (factual core handled by chunk 2; remaining script-rewrites for Good to know + Get in touch voicemail + Step 2 financial eligibility)
- Legal Aid: Senior Legal Helpline hours fix, Coast-to-Coast Legal Aid (Broward) phone fix
- LIHEAP: All-67-counties throughout (factual core handled by chunk 2; remaining application steps + processing/waitlist context + FAQ Q2)

**Next up:**
- Chunk 3 starting now (per TJ "let's continue" after chunk 2 ship)
- After chunk 3: investigate the related-programs data fix (update prompt to constrain to in-state programs, regen) as a separate PR
- Test chunks 1+2 on staging preview when TJ has bandwidth

### 2026-04-26 — /product-led-growth bootstrap + Esther/TJ task split shipped

**Built and shipped `/product-led-growth` slash command.** PR #642 merged to staging (squash, commit `0e674a43`). Two PRs total: V1 daily-mode + V1.5 reframe to daily-build / weekly-stats / monthly-strategy after the dry-run revealed daily-pulse produced false signal from Sunday baselines. Files: `.claude/commands/product-led-growth.md`, `scripts/growth-pull.js`. PR #643 open with Working Principle #8 (trust the implementer, don't over-prescribe when writing Notion tasks for the team).

**Notion infrastructure set up:**
- 📈 [Growth Command Center](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe81ca950ed0d00dde74a9) — weekly snapshot dashboard
- 🧠 [Growth Running Thread](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe8165abf5c4b84d84d06c) — patterns, observations, open questions, run entries
- 🧭 [Growth Strategy Brief](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe8159b1eef1d266f9c62c) — diagnosis, seeker journey design, backlog play, Strategic Backlog

**Strategic diagnosis confirmed by 4-flow code walk:** Olera has no relational mechanism today. Q&A is page comments (no `connections` row, no thread, no reply path). Saves are silent (provider never learns). Benefits intake creates a profile that does nothing afterward. The `connections` table primitive exists in schema; it just isn't being written to for the highest-value interactions.

**Six Notion tasks created/refined across Esther + TJ owners.** Esther's active P1 queue narrowed to 2 items (focus on hire-ROI):
- [Fix save button for non-signed-in users](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe81fb85baf7b7c502859a) — 401s silently for guests; includes contextual save prompt + Slack alerts + admin tile
- [10-views provider nudge](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe8064b7b8c0f8cd7ff8f4) — email providers with proven page-view demand to complete Meet the Author + Photos

TJ's active P1 queue:
- [Increase open rates via follow-up emails](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe80a3989ee19c09dc110a) for unanswered questions
- [Hook the post-answer moment](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe818eb372fb6539e65391) to bring providers into the V2 dashboard
- [Improve benefits intake conversion](https://www.notion.so/34e5903a0ffe813aa547d2cc4378e761) — TJ kept this since he built the original with Chantel

Backlog (deferred for focus): question = profile hook, save = profile strategic UX layer.

**Team kickoff Slack** sent to `#ai-product-development` ([link](https://oleraworkspace.slack.com/archives/C0A91BA205T/p1777244098651849)). Frame: providers respond at ~70% when they land on the answer page, so a lot of the work is about getting them there. Esther + product team meeting tomorrow.

**Writing-style learnings captured to memory** (`feedback_tj_writing_style.md` updated 3x this session):
- Notion tasks: 3 sections max (Context / What we need / Done when), context-rich, don't over-prescribe — collaborators are capable humans with their own design opinions
- TJ voice: no em dashes (use `--`), no rhetorical colons, no flourishes ("the wedge is real but unattended"), no marketing words, numbers stand alone
- Sunday-baseline trap: ran growth-pull on Sunday afternoon and locked "52 questions/day" into multiple tasks. Actual rate is ~70/day. Single-day pulls are not canonical
- Don't simplify TJ's product framing: Olera Pro is a package (reviews, leads, growth tools, GBP optimizations, comparison data, insights, family care profile access), not just one thing. Reducing it to make a clean argument misleads audiences

**Next up:**
- Esther/product team meeting tomorrow on the new task split
- PR #643 (Working Principle #8) ready to merge — ~12 lines added
- First `/product-led-growth --weekly` run on Monday will baseline funnel ratios; revisit deferred items after that data arrives

### 2026-04-26 — Resend webhook integration — SHIPPED + VERIFIED (PRs #635, #637)

**Status:** ✅ live and verified. First real `opened` event landed and `email_log` denormalized columns updated correctly. Loop is closed.

**Verification (2026-04-26 ~12:57 UTC):**
- `email_events` row: `event_type=opened`, `svix_id=msg_3CtZbMfHTSucgRzuXhkRzvH8E9f`, `occurred_at=2026-04-26T12:34:55Z`
- This was a Resend retry of an event that earlier 403'd against Vercel — proves the URL change worked, signature verified, idempotent insert succeeded
- `email_log` denormalized state for the matching email (question_received → tfalohun@gmail.com): `first_opened_at=2026-04-26T12:34:55Z`, `last_event_type=opened`, `last_event_at=2026-04-26T12:34:55Z` ✓

**The pivot:** started from the open Olera Action Items task "Audit provider question/lead notification email — find the open-rate lift" (P1 🔥). Territory mapping uncovered the foundational gap: we don't track email opens at all (only sends + click-throughs via `appendTrackingParams`). Without webhooks, the audit's data path is one-shot (call Resend's API per email, retain nothing). Promoted webhook integration to the primary task; audit becomes downstream and gets re-run on real data once webhooks live.

**The pivot:** started from the open Olera Action Items task "Audit provider question/lead notification email — find the open-rate lift" (P1 🔥).

Without webhooks, the audit's data path is one-shot (call Resend's API per email, retain nothing). Promoted webhook integration to the primary task; audit becomes downstream and gets re-run on real data once webhooks live.

**Notion task created** for the new scope: [Resend webhook integration — unlock email open/click tracking (prerequisite for the email audit)](https://www.notion.so/Resend-webhook-integration-unlock-email-open-click-tracking-prerequisite-for-the-email-audit-34e5903a0ffe81ef87facb32a7437132) — P1 🔥, owner TJ, timeline 2026-05-02. Sibling to the original audit task.

**PR #635 — MERGED to staging** (commit `d6a7387f`). 9 files, +694/-15. Breakdown:
- `supabase/migrations/051_email_webhook_events.sql` (new) — applied to Supabase ✅
- `app/api/resend/webhook/route.ts` (new) — POST handler, raw body, svix signature verify, returns 200 always so Resend doesn't retry
- `lib/resend-events.ts` (new) — `verifyResendSignature()` (uses `svix` npm package, NOT raw HMAC — Resend uses Svix infra) + `recordEmailEvent()` (idempotent insert + monotonic email_log update)
- `scripts/backfill-resend-events.js` (new) — one-shot, manual `--apply` invocation, ~2 req/sec, deterministic `backfill-{resend_id}` svix_id so re-runs are no-ops
- `app/api/admin/emails/route.ts` + `.../export/route.ts` (modified) — extended SELECT to include 7 new lifecycle columns + CSV export columns
- `app/admin/emails/page.tsx` (modified) — `EmailLog` interface extended, new `lifecycleBadge()` helper prefers `last_event_type` (opened/clicked/bounced/etc) over send-time status, preview drawer shows lifecycle timestamps
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — `svix@^1.92.2` added at top-level (was transitive only — Vercel `npm ci` would have failed without this)

**Schema design (chosen — hybrid):**
- New `email_events` table — full event history, one row per webhook delivery, `UNIQUE(svix_id)` for idempotency, joined to `email_log` via `resend_id`
- Denormalized columns on `email_log` — `delivered_at` / `first_opened_at` / `first_clicked_at` / `bounced_at` / `complained_at` / `last_event_type` / `last_event_at` so "open rate" SQL stays a flat scan, no join required
- Why hybrid: pure events table forces a join + aggregation per query; pure denormalized columns lose timeline data. Hybrid gives both.

**Idempotency:** `UNIQUE(svix_id)` enforced at DB level. Replays from Resend hit the constraint and silently no-op. Email_log denormalized columns use monotonic UPDATEs ("first" timestamps only set when null, "last_event" only advances when newer) so out-of-order replays can't move time backward.

**Pre-test bugs caught + fixed before push:**
1. Initial `delivered_at` guard used wrong field (`logRow.last_event_at` instead of `logRow.delivered_at`) and didn't SELECT the column for guarding. Fixed both.
2. Backfill script was treating `result.error` from Resend SDK as "no last_event" instead of surfacing it. Now checks `result.error` explicitly and reports failures.

**Setup state — COMPLETE:**
- ✅ Migration 051 applied to Supabase
- ✅ PR #635 merged (Vercel route + DB schema + admin UI) at `d6a7387f`
- ✅ Vercel returned 403 on Resend POSTs as predicted (Bot Protection vs Svix-on-GCP) — same pattern as Stripe
- ✅ PR #637 merged — webhook ported to Supabase Edge Function
- ✅ Edge Function deployed: `https://ocaabzfiiikjcgqwhbwr.supabase.co/functions/v1/resend-webhook`
- ✅ `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set as Supabase secret (and still in Vercel env for the deprecated route as fallback)
- ✅ Resend webhook URL updated to point at the Supabase function
- ✅ First real `opened` event landed and verified end-to-end (see Verification section above)

**Vercel Bot Protection (confirmed + mitigated):** Resend uses Svix infra on GCP. Vercel's edge Bot Protection layer blocked GCP-origin POSTs with 403. Migrated to Supabase Edge Function — same Svix verify, same idempotent insert, same monotonic UPDATE, just outside Vercel's edge. Vercel route at `app/api/resend/webhook/route.ts` retained with deprecation notice as documented backup.

**Apple Mail caveat (framing for the audit re-open):** Apple Mail Privacy Protection prefetches images on receipt, inflating opens 30-50% for that cohort. Click rate is the cleaner signal for iteration. The audit's "find the open-rate lift" framing should reframe to "find the engagement lift, primarily measured by clicks" when the audit task re-opens.

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ Webhook live + verified.
2. New tile in `/admin/analytics` Providers section: "Opened Q&A emails" (distinct providers who opened a `question_received` email in the window) — shipping in a separate PR alongside this scratchpad update. Apple Mail caveat in the tooltip. Ratio is implicit vs the existing "Questions" tile in Engagement (every question → one email).
3. Re-open the audit task ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/Audit-provider-question-lead-notification-email-Resend-find-the-open-rate-lift)) once ~7 days of real data has accumulated.
4. Optional: run `node scripts/backfill-resend-events.js` to populate ~30 days of history from Resend's retained per-email status.

**Stranded local branches (cleanup):**
- `chore/scratchpad-resend-webhook-pivot` (local, never pushed) — yesterday's mid-session save with the pivot decision but pre-execution state. Superseded by this entry; safe to delete.
- `chore/scratchpad-2026-04-26-webhooks` (current) — this entry.

**Deferred follow-ups (post-merge, separate PRs):**
- Auto-suppression for hard bounces / complaints — needs policy doc (false-positive risk for 60-70yo audience is real)
- `/admin/analytics` Opens tile — best designed as part of the audit re-run, where the consumer picks the right windowed denominator
- A/B testing framework for subject lines — webhooks unlock the data; testing UI is its own scope
- Periodic reconciliation cron — for `email_events` rows where `email_log_id IS NULL` (race: webhook arrives before our send pipeline writes resend_id). Low priority unless we observe lookup misses in practice.
- `email_events` retention policy — table grows ~1k-3k rows/day. Not blocking, but worth a 12-month archive policy eventually.

### 2026-04-25 — Admin Analytics — KPI strip rebuilt + design pass (3 PRs)

**Where it landed:**
- ✅ **PR #632 MERGED** to staging (commit `1519f266`) — grouped KPI strip (Discovery / Engagement / Families), range-aware (follows the date picker), benefits_started instrumentation. Migration 049 applied to staging Supabase.
- ⏸ **PR #633 OPEN** — Providers section (5 distinct-provider tiles). Migration 050 applied. **Superseded by #634** — close after #634 lands.
- ⏸ **PR #634 OPEN** — Design pass (audience grouping, deltas, insight strip, animated counters, URL-encoded range, click-throughs, tooltips, top-providers polish). Includes #633's commits cherry-picked. Active branch: `feature/admin-analytics-design-pass`. Latest commit: `dc7ba414` (audience tints amber-50/70 warm, sky-50/70 cool).

**Layout that landed in #634 (Wave 1 design pass):**

```
[ Insight strip ]   ✦ "Page views up 100% last 7 days (2,181 vs 1,066 prior)."
[ Last 7 days ]
  Care seekers   (warm amber tint)
    Discovery        Page views · Unique sessions · Card clicks
    Engagement       Questions · Leads · Reviews
    Family funnel    Benefits started · Benefits finished · Profiles published
  Providers      (cool sky tint)
    Sign-ins from Q&A · Page-flow claims · Answered questions · Engaged with leads · Clicked dashboard CTA
[ Top providers ]   sortable, display name primary, slug as muted mono
[ Latest 50 events ]
[ Footer ]   "Bot rejects today: N" — relocated out of the windowed card
```

Per-tile delta lines (↑12% emerald / ↓4% rose / "flat" gray / "new" emerald), tooltips, click-throughs to filtered admin views, animated counters (cubic ease-out 600ms), `?preset=7d` URL param.

**Files modified across all 3 PRs:**
- `supabase/migrations/049_benefits_started_event.sql` (new) — applied
- `supabase/migrations/050_claim_completed_event.sql` (new) — applied
- `app/api/admin/analytics/summary/route.ts` — major rewrite, range-aware + prior-window deltas + insight generator + olera-providers name lookup
- `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` — major rewrite, audience grouping, all polish touches
- `app/api/activity/track/route.ts` — `benefits_started` added to ANONYMOUS_EVENT_TYPES
- `app/api/benefits/track-start/route.ts` — DB persist on top of existing Slack alert + sessionId
- `app/api/claim/finalize/route.ts` — fires `claim_completed` with `metadata.source='email'`
- `app/api/provider/claim-listing/route.ts` — fires `claim_completed` with `metadata.source='page'`, keyed on slug
- `components/providers/BenefitsDiscoveryModule.tsx` — passes sessionId to track-start
- `hooks/use-animated-count.ts` (new) — value-tweening hook (re-runs on value change, unlike useAnimatedCounters which only fires on mount)

**Wave 2 (deferred — not in #634):**
- Per-tile sparklines (60×16 mini-charts inside each tile) — needs new time-series-per-metric endpoint
- Multi-series chart upgrade with annotations + benchmarks — needs annotations data model + design conversation

**Resume next session:** TJ tested #634's preview. Once happy, `/pr-merge 634` to staging, then close #633. Wave 2 sparklines + chart upgrade is the natural follow-up.

**Key decisions locked in this session:**
- "Search clicks" was misleading (counted card click-throughs from results pages, not home-page search) → renamed "Card clicks" in the UI; underlying event_type stays `search_click`. Home-page search button remains uninstrumented (deferred).
- "CTA clicks" tile dropped — only ever counted Save (heart) clicks; Connect/Contact instrumentation was a never-shipped TODO. Underlying `cta_click_public` event still used by provider-side dashboards.
- Two claim endpoints map naturally to source attribution: `/api/provider/claim-listing` → `source='page'`, `/api/claim/finalize` → `source='email'`. No request-body `source` param needed.
- Distinct-provider counts (not raw events) for Providers section — different shape than the rest of the strip but matches "how many people did X" framing.
- `lead_opened` event is whitelisted in CHECK but never written by any code path. Switched "Engaged with leads" filter to `one_click_access AND metadata.action='lead'` (production has 2 such events confirming the path fires). If we later instrument a real lead_opened in the portal, can swap back.
- Audience grouping (Care seekers / Providers) replaces the inconsistent flat 4-section labels (Discovery/Engagement/Families/Providers — three actions + one audience).
- Audience tints: started at /30 opacity → looked like off-white smudges → bumped to /70 (amber warm, sky cool) so they read as intentional design, not render artifacts.
- claim_completed (page-flow) keyed on `providerSlug` not `providerId` — matches the slug format every other anonymous event uses, enables future cross-event joins. Email-flow path still uses providerId since slug isn't in that body — known caveat.

**Pre-test bugs caught + fixed before push:**
- PR #632: "All time" preset returned last-24h (endpoint defaulted to 24h fallback when no params)
- PR #633: "Engaged with leads" filtered on `lead_opened` which has zero rows ever in production
- PR #634: skeleton flickered on range change (re-mounted tiles, broke counter tween); 3-tile rows in 5-col grid created awkward empty columns; claim_completed keyed on wrong ID format

### 2026-04-23 — Provider Analytics — Phase 2 (Dashboard Redesign) — ALL PILLARS BUILT, ready for PR polish + merge

**Phase 2 Brief (live doc):** https://www.notion.so/34b5903a0ffe81098302ce55d5df2a4d — source of truth for this workstream. Decisions + open questions live there.

**Branch:** `feature/dashboard-redesign-phase-2a-score-extension` — 8 commits ahead of staging, DRAFT PR #625.

**Resume next session:** Load this file, you'll have full context. Top priorities:
1. Run `/pre-test` — clean review of the 8 commits on the branch
2. Verify mobile responsive layout (right-sidebar stack on narrow viewports)
3. Mark PR #625 ready for review, then `/pr-merge 625`
4. Post-merge: pick the next ⏳ item from Phase 2 backlog below

**Where Phase 2 stands (2026-04-23 EOD):**
- ✅ 2A Score extension — 7 → 9 weighted sections (Reviews + Response Rate) in `lib/profile-completeness.ts`. Backward-compat preserved.
- ✅ Unified `/api/provider/dashboard` endpoint — greeting + activity + reviews + response-rate + cohort in one payload. Commit `9e0cb303`.
- ✅ Pillar A (DashboardHero) — priority-ranked greeting with one primary action CTA. `components/provider-dashboard/v2/DashboardHero.tsx`
- ✅ Pillar C (CohortContextCard) — reframed cohort demand narrative. `components/provider-dashboard/v2/CohortContextCard.tsx`
- ✅ Pillar D (ReviewInvitationsCard) — contextual review invitations, non-sales-y. `components/provider-dashboard/v2/ReviewInvitationsCard.tsx`
- ✅ Pillar E (RecentActivityCard) — merged timeline of questions/leads/reviews/views. `components/provider-dashboard/v2/RecentActivityCard.tsx`
- ✅ Pillar F (TrafficSummaryCard) — compact KPI snapshot + deep link to `/portal/analytics`. `components/provider-dashboard/v2/TrafficSummaryCard.tsx`
- ✅ All pillars wired into `/provider` behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROVIDER_ANALYTICS_ONBOARD` flag (`components/provider-dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` lines 310-325).
- ✅ Completeness sidebar shows 9 sections when v2 data available.
- ✅ Onboard teaser CTA repointed `/portal/analytics` → `/provider` ("See your dashboard").
- ✅ Weekly digest email CTA repointed `/portal/analytics` → `/provider` (`lib/email-templates.tsx` line 995).
- ✅ `/portal/analytics` header rebranded "Analytics" → "Traffic report" with back-to-dashboard link. Deliberately KEPT the route (it's a sub-report now, not a parallel home).
- ⏳ Final `/pre-test` + PR merge to staging.
- ⏳ Mobile responsive check — right sidebar should stack below on narrow viewports; confirmed by DOM but TJ should eyeball on mobile.
- ⏳ Phase 2 polish items (below) — defer to post-merge PRs.

**Phase 2 deferred / polish backlog (post-merge):**
- 🚫 Cohort card zero-demand variant — on staging the cohort shows demand=0 because no real organic traffic hits other TX Assisted Living pages. Card hides correctly by design. Real prod traffic will light it up. **Decided Option A: ship as-is, revisit after prod data accumulates.**
- Geocode business_profiles.city+state → lat/lon so radius-tier cohort works for providers without `source_provider_id` (Aggie + any future claim-flow-skipping providers).
- Pull shared cohort helpers out of `/api/provider/dashboard/route.ts` + `/api/provider/analytics/route.ts` (currently duplicated — Phase 2 TODO noted inline).
- Resend email BASE_URL handling — templates hardcode staging URL so notification emails always point at staging-olera2-web regardless of where we're testing. Proper fix: fallback to `VERCEL_URL` env var with staging as last resort. Not a blocker; workaround is to manually swap hostname in email URL when testing on preview.

**Key decisions locked in:**
- One unified dashboard at `/provider` is the home base. `/portal/analytics` survives as the detailed Traffic Report sub-page (cleaner than folding 606 lines into `/provider`).
- Quality score weights signed off (9 sections; heaviest on Gallery 15%, Reviews 15%, Response Rate 12%).
- Single scrolling page, no tabs.
- Same feature flag as onboard teaser — launches together.
- Review invitations framing is contextual + honest, NEVER sales-y — 60-70yo facility operators have been burned by Caring.com/APFM-style "get more business" hooks, that framing violates trust.
- First-principles over iteration per TJ's "what if current design sucks" instinct.

**Branch commit history (8 commits on feature/dashboard-redesign-phase-2a-score-extension):**
1. `446a4d85` — Extend completion score to 9 weighted sections
2. `9e0cb303` — Add /api/provider/dashboard unified endpoint
3. `76a248a7` — Wire Phase 2 dashboard pillars into /provider behind FF
4. `eea974ba` — Fix four Phase 2 bugs caught in pre-test (dead routes, dead anchors, fabricated stats, wasted fetch)
5. `5bdcd479` — Log end-of-session state for Phase 2 dashboard redesign
6. `8eabdd30` — Add cohort trace to /api/provider/dashboard for diagnostics (_debug field)
7. `d5b878cd` — Add Pillars D + F and repoint analytics CTAs to /provider
8. `[latest]` — Remove _debug diagnostic from dashboard endpoint (cohort behavior is working as designed)

**CohortContextCard diagnostic result (2026-04-23 evening):**
TJ loaded his dashboard on preview, pasted the `_debug` payload. Trace showed:
- Aggie has `source_provider_id: null` → no lat/lon → radius tiers correctly skipped (no-geo)
- State tier ran: 1000 TX Assisted Living slugs from `olera-providers` → passed 5-provider threshold
- Demand query returned 0 unique sessions → card hides correctly (by design — zero-demand would contradict pipeline-opportunity framing)
- **Conclusion: working as designed. Will light up in production with real traffic. Diagnostic code removed in commit 8.**

**Testing state:**
- ✅ Pillar A, E verified rendering by TJ on preview build `d5b878cd`
- ⏳ Pillars D, F — built but not visually verified by TJ yet (right sidebar stacks below on narrow viewports; TJ needs to scroll or widen window to see)
- ⏳ Full `/pre-test` pass on the 8-commit branch before merge

**Current preview URL** (check via `gh pr checks 625` to confirm latest):
`olera-web-git-feature-dashboard-redesign-phase-2a-06a582-olera.vercel.app`

**Strategy doc (parent thread):** https://www.notion.so/34a5903a0ffe81f7ad56d6d85514d52f
**Phase 0 plan:** `plans/provider-analytics-phase-0-instrumentation-plan.md` (shipped)
**Phase 1 plan:** `plans/provider-analytics-phase-1-surfaces-plan.md` (shipped to staging)

**Where everything stands overall:**
- Phase 0 (instrumentation) → SHIPPED (PR #620)
- Phase 1 (surfaces v1) → SHIPPED (PRs #623, #624, chore/dejank-onboard-teaser)
- Phase 2 (dashboard redesign) → mid-build on current branch
- Phase 3 (L3 monetization) → still deferred

**Phase 0 — DONE.** PR #620 merged to staging at commit `b18b08d6`. Instrumentation live. Admin sanity view at `/admin/analytics`. Nightly aggregation cron at 8 AM UTC. [Merge report](https://www.notion.so/34a5903a0ffe8163a88fd2569f8009c3).

**Phase 1 sub-phases shipped on the branch:**
- ✅ 1A Data layer — `/api/provider/analytics` endpoint, `lib/analytics/triage.ts`, migration 046 (provider-owner RLS, applied)
- ✅ 1B Onboard teaser card — `<AnalyticsTeaserCard />` in `ProfilePreviewCard`. Three tier variants (low=pipeline-opportunity framing, medium/high=personal count + delta + source). Behind feature flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROVIDER_ANALYTICS_ONBOARD=true` (set on Vercel Preview env, NOT Production).
- ✅ 1C Dashboard — `/portal/analytics`. Owner-gated. Pipeline banner, KPI grid, trend chart, sources, funnel/summary, peer cohort. Not flag-gated.
- ✅ 1D Weekly digest — `/api/cron/weekly-provider-digest` (Mondays 13:00 UTC), tier-aware email template, new opt-out channel via extended `/api/providers/unsubscribe?type=analytics_digest`.
- ⏸ 1B task 8 — sequence reviews copy by analytics state. Deferred (needs shared state refactor).
- ⏸ 1E — distribution-derived thresholds, A/B rollout. Needs ~2 weeks real data.

**Bugs caught + fixed during this session (5 in total):**
1. Teaser card misleading copy when cohort data null + some personal views exist
2. Dashboard PipelineBanner deflating "0 families searched" empty state — hide when 0
3. Weekly digest cron missed legacy providers whose `provider_activity.provider_id` is a `source_provider_id` — added fallback lookup
4. `accounts.select().single()` returning 500 instead of friendly 400 — switched to `.maybeSingle()`
5. `reached_your_page_count` (cohort-stale-unique) contradicting `views.this_period` (real-time-raw) in adjacent dashboard UI — aligned both to `viewsThisPeriod`

**Test results from preview (TJ verified 2026-04-22 evening):**
- ✅ Dashboard at `/portal/analytics` renders perfectly. KPI grid, trend chart, sources, funnel all working.
- ✅ Teaser card appears on reload — confirmed tier-low fallback copy "Your traffic is just getting started" / "1 family viewed your page this month" working as designed.
- 🔴 → ✅ Teaser card invisible on FIRST load (auth race — auto-sign-in not done before fetch). Latest fix `36f172b9` added `useAuth` gate so card waits for auth resolution before fetching. Re-test pending.
- 🟡 → ✅ Funnel bar overflowed at 900% width because question_received historic count exceeded brand-new page_view count. Fixed to use max(stages) as denominator + visual cap at 100%. Renamed "Engagement funnel" → "Engagement summary" since the funnel metaphor breaks when step N exceeds step N-1.

**Notion email-link host issue (not a bug, an environmental constraint):**
Real notification emails sent via Resend point at `staging-olera2-web.vercel.app`, not the preview URL. To test the onboard flow on preview, take a real email's URL and **swap the hostname** for the preview branch URL. The `otk` token signature still verifies because preview + staging share `CLAIM_TOKEN_SECRET`.

**Latest commit:** `36f172b9` (auth race fix + funnel cap). Pre-test passed clean — no new bugs.

**Pre-PR refinement decided 2026-04-22 evening:** Add real-time adaptive cohort fallback to `/api/provider/analytics` BEFORE shipping. Rationale: tonight's preview test showed Aggie's teaser falling back to "1 family viewed your page" (raw count) instead of the pipeline-opportunity framing ("X families searched your area"). Cause: cohort data only comes from the nightly cron which hasn't run yet. Decision: real-time fallback + adaptive widening, ship the polished version.

### Adaptive cohort widening spec (next code change)

**Where:** `/api/provider/analytics/route.ts` — extend the cohort/pipeline_opportunity query branch.

**Logic (try in order, first one with cohort_size >= 5 wins):**
1. `(city, state, category)` — city-level
2. `(state, category)` — state-level fallback
3. `(state, *)` — state, all-categories last-resort fallback

**Real-time vs aggregation table:**
- For Phase 1B', query `provider_activity` directly (real-time COUNT(DISTINCT session_id))
- The nightly cron's `provider_page_view_stats` continues to power historical trend lines (separate use case)
- Acceptable because Phase 1 volume is low; Phase 2 might need caching

**Response shape addition:**
- `pipeline_opportunity.scope: "city" | "state" | "state-all"` — so card/dashboard can pick correct copy

**Copy per scope:**
- city → "X families searched for [category] in [city] this month"
- state → "X families searched for [category] in [state] this month"
- state-all → "X families searched for senior care in [state] this month"

**Cohort lookup approach:**
1. Get cohort provider slugs: `SELECT slug FROM "olera-providers" WHERE state=$1 AND provider_category=$2 [AND city=$3]` (city filter conditional)
2. Threshold check: if rows < 5, fall to next widening tier
3. Once cohort settled, COUNT(DISTINCT metadata->>'session_id') from `provider_activity` for those provider_ids in window

**Provider's own traffic IS included in `local_demand_count`.** Framing is "demand in your area" + "your slice of it" — both include same provider, X ⊃ Y semantically.

**UI changes needed after endpoint update:**
- AnalyticsTeaserCard `buildHeadline` / `buildSubline`: use `pipeline_opportunity.scope` to pick the right "[city]" vs "[state]" wording
- Dashboard PipelineBanner: same scope-aware copy

### Deferred to Phase 2 (decisions made tonight)

- **Geographic-radius cohorts** (lat/lon proximity instead of city name match) — better matches "near me" search behavior. Requires PostGIS or distance math + lat/lon completeness.
- **Population-density-weighted radius** — rural vs urban "near me" semantic difference.
- **Cron computing multi-granularity benchmarks** (city + state + state-all) so dashboard trend lines also adapt.
- **Cohort excluding own traffic** if framing pivots from "your area's demand including you" to "competitive landscape excluding you."

### Next action sequence (post-compact resume)

1. ⏭ Implement adaptive cohort widening in `/api/provider/analytics/route.ts` (~30 min)
2. ⏭ Update AnalyticsTeaserCard + dashboard PipelineBanner copy to consume `scope` field
3. ⏭ `/pre-test` one more sweep
4. ⏭ Commit + push
5. ⏭ Open PR to staging (admin bypass merge per CLAUDE.md)
6. ⏭ Apply migration 046 via Supabase dashboard if not already
7. ⏭ Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROVIDER_ANALYTICS_ONBOARD=true` on staging env (Production stays off until full launch)
8. ⏭ Phase 1B task 8 (sequenced reviews copy) and Phase 1E (distribution-derived thresholds + A/B) are the natural follow-ups

**Most important deferred strategic question (Phase 3+):** What is Olera's L3 / monetizable layer? — captured in strategy doc as the highest-priority open question.

### 2026-04-21 → 2026-04-22 — 176-city expansion batch complete

176-city senior-care provider expansion. Ran end-to-end via `/city-pipeline`. No code changes — DB + Notion writes only.

**Final stats:**
- 170/176 cities loaded with providers; 6 empty (Holtsville NY, Hampton PA, Penn PA, Burke Centre VA, Bethpage NY, Weston WI — all survived 0 providers after keyword + AI classify + Perplexity entity verification + dedup)
- 3,655 active providers inserted (from 30,304 discovered → 5,754 post-classify → 2,099 soft-deleted by trust-signal entity verification)
- Enrichment: 5,751 descriptions, 1,824 trust signals confirmed, 4,836 review snippets, 4,044 images
- Cost: $386.57 (11,807 Google + 1,750 Perplexity calls)
- Wall time: ~9h15m (discovery 1h25m → clean 3h50m → load 45m → enrich 2h40m → finalize 5m)
- Pipeline logs: `/tmp/pipeline-all.log`, `/tmp/discovery-2026-04-21.log` (both will rotate)

**Data quality (verified via subagent spot-check during enrich):**
- 0 null place_ids, 0 bad categories, 0 out-of-state coordinates, 0 LLC/Inc/Corp suffixes
- Fixed 1 edge case: `vail-az-0005` had " LLP" suffix — stripped post-enrichment
- Name Check regex in pipeline doesn't catch LLP — consider adding for future batches

**Why clean took 3h50m (not "~5 min" per skill):** pooled AI classify ran on 30,304 providers (batch of 80 at a time × ~380 API calls × seconds each + retries). Skill's estimate was based on smaller batches. Expect proportional scaling on future big batches.

**Notion:** all 176 pages flipped "Upload to Backend" → "Complete" via subagent (14 Done boxes checked except "Fetch Email & Contact Info" per skill convention).

**Followups (low priority, carry forward):**
1. **ND/SD not in Notion State select** — Jamestown ND, Mitchell SD, Yankton SD got pages without State value. Add ND/SD options when convenient.
2. ~~**Stale Notion pages in "Discovery" status**~~ — CLEANED UP 2026-04-22. 128 stuck pages audited against Supabase: 127 flipped to Complete (100 from 2026-04-02 bulk seed + 16 more from same batch + 12 from 2026-04-15 184-city batch subagent misses). Port St. John, FL (0 providers after filters) soft-archived.
3. **6 empty cities** — safe to remove from expansion map as "verified empty" (no senior-care providers after all filters).
4. **Live-site check at end showed 5 FAILs** — cosmetic ISR cache warming noise per skill docs, not real failures. Pages will work after ISR warms (~1hr).

### 2026-04-21 — Admin Pulse Header (Questions + Leads)

**Branch:** `glad-pare` (tracks `origin/glad-pare`, no PR to `staging` yet — TJ has more feedback to land first)
**Head:** `540825b3`

Built a "pulse header" for `/admin/questions` and `/admin/leads`:
- Title + KPI ("X needing email") + delta line + full-width interactive chart
- Single date-range popover button (7 presets + custom from/to) replacing the old 3-row filter chrome
- Tabs, search, list, inline email form, archive/delete flows untouched

**Files created:**
- `lib/admin-stats.ts` — bucket helpers (hour/day/week/month auto-pick)
- `app/api/admin/questions/stats/route.ts` — returns `{ total, delta, series, bucket }`
- `app/api/admin/leads/stats/route.ts` — same shape
- `components/admin/DateRangePopover.tsx` — single-button popover with presets + stacked From/To custom range
- `components/admin/PulseHeader.tsx` — title/KPI/delta/sparkline + Y-axis max label + gridline + hover tooltip

**Files modified:**
- `app/admin/questions/page.tsx` — integrated PulseHeader, removed old header + filter chrome
- `app/admin/leads/page.tsx` — same

**Iteration log (why this took 8 commits):**
1. `6c9e9a34` — initial 48px sparkline — "looked bad"
2. `d4eded07` — width bug (ResizeObserver never attached) + empty-state bug (`Math.max(1, …)` masked all-zero case)
3. `382a49da` — height 140→180, padding 22px, UTC label formatting to fix Apr 13/14 off-by-one
4. `1811ac49` — added max-value label + dashed gridline at ceiling so peaks read as "at max" not "clipped"
5. `bb2bbddc` — tried hardcoded Y-max at 120 (TJ asked)
6. `10b95517` — TJ pushed back: hardcoded ages badly. Replaced with `niceCeiling()` auto-scale (1.5x → round up to 1/1.5/2/2.5/3/4/5/6/8/10 × 10^n). Added 90ms ease-out CSS transitions on SVG hover elements + row action slide-in translate.
7. `d1cee83a` — **semantic split**: KPI shows needs-email count (time-bounded), chart shows ALL question volume. Single DB query, two metrics computed in memory.
8. `540825b3` — **linear interpolation** (dropped Fritsch-Carlson monotone cubic). Smooth curves created "upward inflection" illusion — user read intermediate Bezier y-values as data that didn't exist. Also bumped niceCeiling 1.5x → 1.75x for peaks in 40-55% zone. Default range "all" → "30d". Stroke 1.75→2.

**Design decisions locked in:**
- **Chart ≠ KPI** intentionally. KPI is action queue (needs-email). Chart is platform pulse (all activity). Two metrics on one card — contextualizes the number with volume context.
- **Linear over smooth.** Monotone cubic's S-shape between discrete daily buckets visually implies intermediate values that don't exist. Linear = most honest read of time-series. Matches Linear / Stripe / Datadog.
- **Nice-number Y-axis**, not fixed. Hardcoded ceilings don't age with growth. `niceCeiling(realMax)` rounds up to clean steps with 1.75x headroom → peaks always at 40-55% of chart.
- **Server buckets UTC days**, labels formatted in UTC to match. Admin chart represents UTC-day windows; admin user understands this.
- **Date range popover > multi-row chips.** One button, one popover. Presets list (all/today/yesterday/7d/30d/90d/1y) + stacked custom From/To at bottom of dropdown. Widened from w-72 to w-80 so From/To inputs don't overflow.

**Hover feel:**
- Chart hover dot + crosshair + tooltip all smooth-follow (90ms ease-out on SVG cx/cy/x1/x2 and HTML left/top)
- Row action buttons (Archive/Remove/Delete) slide in 4px from right on row hover (translate-x-1 → translate-x-0 + opacity, 200ms)
- Popover still hard appears — low priority

**Known cross-page inconsistency (not fixed):**
- Admin overview card "Needs Email: X" is all-time count
- `/admin/leads?tab=needs_email` now opens at last-30-days default
- Numbers will differ between the two views
- Fixes: either scope the overview card to 30d, or pass `?range=all` when navigating from overview. Awaiting TJ's call.

**Other known limits (not bugs today):**
- `.limit(50000)` with `ascending: true` means if platform ever has >50k questions/leads, we'd fetch the oldest 50k and miss recent. Olera is at ~1300 questions. Non-issue.
- Chart first-hover pops in instantly (no fade-in). Subsequent moves smooth. Acceptable.

**TJ said "I have a few things to add"** — next feedback loop incoming. Pausing here.

## Blocked / Needs Input

- ~~**Migration Playbook → Notion:**~~ ✅ Done (2026-03-01) — updated via Notion MCP
- ~~**Top 100 pages from Search Console:**~~ ✅ Done — GSC export analyzed, 0 404 risks found
- ~~**Editorial content redirect decision:**~~ ✅ Done — all v1.0 content routes now have redirects in `next.config.ts`: `/research-and-press/*` → homepage, `/caregiver-forum/*` → `/`, `/caregiver-relief-network/*` → homepage, `/company/*` → dedicated pages

---

## Next Up

**After PR `feat/data-sweep-skill` merges:**
- Backfill `google_reviews_data.{places_types, business_status, country_code}` for existing 70,722 active providers (Stream B only populates this on next sync — separate one-shot script if we want it sooner).
- Run sweep #2 in ~3 months (default quarterly cadence) on full DB — see runbook for procedure. Validate the v2.2 regex isn't catching new patterns before scrapping it for sweep #3.
- Wrong-category cleanup of `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` providers (~50K) — would need different prompt + signal (website fetch, Google Places `types`).
- Migrate the 13-type backend `ProfileCategory` enum down to the 6 — separate workstream for claim UI restriction + dead enum cleanup.

0. **Re-open the email audit task** ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/Audit-provider-question-lead-notification-email-Resend-find-the-open-rate-lift)) after ~7 days of real webhook data accumulates. Reframe primary metric from "open-rate lift" to "engagement lift, primarily clicks" given Apple Mail noise.
0a. **Wave 2 admin analytics polish** — per-tile sparklines + multi-series chart upgrade with annotations. Deferred from PR #634 (which merged 2026-04-25). Needs a new time-series-per-metric endpoint.
1. **MedJobs candidates detail page taste pass** — Apply warm surface + Perena-inspired styling to `/medjobs/candidates/[slug]` and `/provider/medjobs/candidates/[slug]`
2. **MedJobs provider onboarding flow** — Ensure MedJobs tab → browse → candidate detail → auth → contact is butter smooth end-to-end
3. **Enrichment questions after connection** — Add follow-up questions after seeker submits connection to feed into their profile (separate workstream from onboard redesign)
4. **De-jank provider transitions** — Airbnb-smooth state transitions across provider flows (notification → dashboard, claim → portal)
5. **SEO Action 1: City-specific content sections** — Add cost snapshot, "Paying for Care" module (waiver library links), city stats, FAQ section to browse pages
2. **SEO Action 2: Internal linking** — Link caregiver articles → city pages, waiver library → city pages, nearby city cross-links
3. **SEO Action 3: Structured data + meta** — FAQ schema, AggregateRating schema, cost/review-enriched meta descriptions
4. **SEO Action 4: More caregiver content** — 10-15 articles targeting financial/benefits queries (Medicare, Medicaid, cost guides)
5. **Merge PR #219** (waiver library redesign) — waiting on Chantel to remove `package.json.tmp` + `.mcp.json`
6. **Fix Supabase 1000-row limit** in provider sitemap shards (returns 1000 instead of 10,000)
7. **Debug auto-sign-in** — check `[OneClick]` console logs, fix background auth
8. **Phase 2: Activity Center PII tracking** — log "viewed_lead_pii" events, Slack alerts for sensitive interactions
9. **Unmask question/review content** on onboard notification cards (public data, no privacy concern)
10. **Delete fake seed connections** from Supabase (Sarah Reynolds, James Adeyemi, etc.)
11. **Run backfill script** for source_provider_id (dry-run first): `scripts/backfill-source-provider-id.js`
12. **Add `CLAIM_TOKEN_SECRET` env var** to Vercel (currently falls back to SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)

## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
| 2026-04-27 | Scrap regex amnesia detector for LLM self-correction pass | After 5 regex iterations (v1 → v2.2) chasing TJ-flagged FPs, recognized regex-on-LLM-free-text is fundamentally fragile. Forced-choice anti-amnesia prompt on the 2,936 OUT_OF_SCOPE verdicts gave structured output for ~$5 in 4 min. Replaced regex output entirely. |
| 2026-04-27 | Generate disagreements file as third review artifact | When two noisy signals disagree (regex v2.2 vs LLM re-pass), the cases worth highest scrutiny are the 233 disagreements (8% of OUT_OF_SCOPE). Cheap to produce, valuable for spot-check, surfaces blindspots in either signal. |
| 2026-04-27 | Backup CSVs written BEFORE DB writes, not after | If execution fails partway, we still have the full intended-state record. Recovery is a single SQL UPDATE per CSV. Previous data sweeps generated backups after which is recoverable but more painful. |
| 2026-04-27 | Tighten discovery search terms over relying on entity verification to clean up | Sweep #1's $160 entity verification cost reflects too-loose discovery: '55+', 'senior apartments', 'rehab center', 'cognitive care' pulled massive false positives. Tightening discovery prevents pollution; cheaper than per-batch LLM cleanup. |
| 2026-04-27 | Forced-choice prompts > free-text reasoning for verification | Free-text LLM reasoning often contradicts its own verdict (amnesia: "Non-medical home care provider" → marked OUT_OF_SCOPE). Forced-choice with anti-amnesia guidance forces the LLM to commit to one of {6 cats, NONE} without contradicting itself. |
| 2026-03-28 | MedJobs candidates page is a search tool, not a gallery | Hiring is purposeful evaluation, not emotional discovery. Giant image blocks waste space when most students don't have photos. List rows let providers scan 8-10 candidates per screen vs 3. |
| 2026-03-28 | Any authenticated user sees contact info (not just providers) | Provider profile creation is progressive profiling, not a prerequisite. Gating on "is provider" after auth creates a second wall that breaks the onboarding flow. |
| 2026-03-28 | Infinite scroll over pagination buttons | Pagination feels dated and adds cognitive load. IntersectionObserver with 200px rootMargin pre-fetches the next batch before the user reaches bottom. Feels like Telegram. |
| 2026-03-28 | Onboard page is a platform showcase, not a profile editor | Provider's first impression should be "here's what Olera can do" not "fill out these 7 forms." Profile completion is ONE compact card, not the entire page. |
| 2026-03-28 | Platform cards use router.push, not Link elements | Avoids DOM swap when isSignedIn changes (div→Link remount re-triggers animations). Single div with onClick handler works for both auth states. |
| 2026-03-28 | Guard isNotificationEntry on notificationData presence | ActionCard notification renders require data — without it, renders nothing. SmartDashboardShell must check `&& !!notificationData` before treating as notification entry. Falls back to verify-form. |
| 2026-03-28 | No new API endpoints for v1 of onboard redesign | Value cards use aspirational copy + existing provider data (google_reviews_data). Live counts (lead count in area, Q&A pending) are a fast follow once design is validated. |
| 2026-03-28 | Profile editing removed from onboard page | Wizard/inline editing moves to the portal Dashboard. Onboard page is the "lobby" — sells the vision. Portal is where they work. |
| 2026-03-28 | MedJobs card on onboard is placeholder for now | Feature is early, will be refined in next work session with proper data + design |
| 2026-03-27 | /welcome page must be static, not force-dynamic | Server component ran 3+ Supabase queries that always fail for guests (no session cookie). Blocked page render 2-3s + AuthProvider timeout 5s = 6-8s blank screen. Static page + client-side data fetching = instant render. |
| 2026-03-27 | Never gate /welcome page render on auth state | Connection card, step cards, greeting all work without auth. Auth resolving in background upgrades the UI (profile %, live status) but shouldn't block first paint. Show skeleton for async data, not a loading spinner for the whole page. |
| 2026-03-27 | Side-by-side card layout (square image) > landscape hero for provider cards | Landscape aspect ratio crops provider logos/photos badly — most provider images are logos or square portraits, not wide photos. Square image left + content right works for all image shapes. |
| 2026-03-27 | City page SEO = content depth + authority, not technical fixes | Pages rank 35-60 because they're thin provider lists on a new domain (DA ~5). Competitors have DA 60-75 and editorial city guides. On-page fixes → position 20-25; page 1 requires 3-6mo authority building from article strategy |
| 2026-03-27 | Waiver Library is the unique SEO weapon for city pages | Nobody else connects Medicaid waiver program data to city browse pages. "Paying for Care" module linking waiver library to city pages gives Google content it can't find elsewhere |
| 2026-03-27 | Rename `token` query param to `otk` in email links | Apple Mail Link Tracking Protection strips params named "token" (both click and copy). `otk` (one-time key) is not on Apple's strip list. This was the root cause of ~10 failed debugging rounds. |
| 2026-03-27 | One-click flow stays on onboard page, not redirect to Leads | The onboard page (notification card hero + dashboard) IS the intended landing. Redirecting to Leads table gives first-time providers nothing to trust. Trojan horse: lead hooks, dashboard sells. |
| 2026-03-27 | Never name URL params `token`, `session`, `key` in email links | Email clients (Apple Mail, Outlook, privacy extensions) strip params that look like auth credentials. Use abbreviations: `otk`, `sid`, `k`. |
| 2026-03-27 | Finalize claim BEFORE refreshAccountData in one-click flow | First-time providers have no account until finalize creates it. Refreshing before finalize returns empty profiles → downstream pages break. |
| 2026-03-27 | Use createAuthClient() (implicit flow) for server-generated verifyOtp | SSR browser client forces PKCE. Server-generated magic link tokens don't have a code_challenge. Must use implicit flow + session transfer. Pattern documented in lib/supabase/auth-client.ts. |
| 2026-03-27 | Fetch notification data server-side in validate-token | The connections table has RLS — unauthenticated browser client can't read it. Notification data must be fetched server-side (service role key) and returned with the token validation response. |
| 2026-03-27 | Notification card display must never depend on auth state | The notification card is the hook — it must render for unauthenticated providers. All data it needs must come from server-side APIs (validate-token), not client-side queries that require auth. |
| 2026-03-26 | Lead email is Trojan horse — dashboard is the product demo | Bare notification page would look like another lead-gen scam. Providers burned by APFM/Caring.com need to see the full platform (gallery, reviews, completeness) to believe Olera is real. Hero card hooks, dashboard below sells. |
| 2026-03-26 | Always mask seeker info on onboard page | `isSignedIn` doesn't mean verified owner of this listing. Protect seekers in case email goes to wrong recipient. First name only, no photo, city only, message truncated. Full info after claiming. |
| 2026-03-26 | Notification card overrides "already claimed" for email entry | Provider clicking email link and seeing "This listing is claimed — Dispute" is hostile. Show the lead/question/review preview instead, let them verify to respond. |
| 2026-03-26 | BP-only providers need slug-based fallback in claim check | Second claim check queries by source_provider_id, which is NULL for BP-only providers. Fallback query by slug catches them. |
| 2026-03-26 | Dark CTA buttons (bg-gray-900) for provider onboarding | Matches MedJobs aesthetic — calm confidence over teal SaaS template. Consistent across provider-facing surfaces. |
| 2026-03-26 | One-click email tokens for provider onboarding (Phase 2) | Email IS the verification — asking for OTP after they clicked the email is proving the same thing twice. Signed JWT in email link = one click from email to full portal access. Zero friction. |
| 2026-03-26 | Two tiers, not three: Full Access + Trusted | Full access via one-click token (everything including seeker PII). Trusted tier (phone call from Olera) only for destructive actions (delete listing, transfer ownership). Middle "Verified" tier was mud that solved a problem we don't have at current scale. |
| 2026-03-26 | Observability over gates for PII protection | At 5-10 leads/day with ~10% provider engagement, manual oversight is feasible. Activity Center + Slack alerts when provider views seeker PII. Human review, not software gates. Gates only when volume demands it. |
| 2026-03-26 | Phone call (not SMS OTP) for Trusted tier | Senior care providers are 60-70yo facility operators. SMS OTP = friction and confusion. Human phone call to business number = highest trust, zero tech friction, builds relationship. Rare actions only (~2-3/week). |
| 2026-03-26 | Questions and reviews don't need privacy masking | Q&A and reviews are already public on the provider page. Only leads contain private seeker PII. Showing full question/review text on onboard page is fine and more compelling. |
| 2026-03-25 | Full apply must retry account creation if apply-partial failed | Two-phase form (partial on step 1, full on step 4) means the full submit UPDATE path must check `account_id` and create auth+account if null. Silent try/catch in apply-partial hid the failure |
| 2026-03-25 | `hero_image_url` column doesn't exist in `olera-providers` | The set_hero action wrote to it but it was never added to the table schema. All references must use `select("*")` and guard with `"hero_image_url" in provider` |
| 2026-03-25 | Hover overlay > exposed pill buttons for image actions | Colored pills (yellow/red/green) below each image were visual noise. Dark gradient overlay with icon buttons on hover — images are content, buttons are tools |
| 2026-03-25 | Quick discovery mode (3 terms/category) is sufficient for batch | Standard mode (12 terms) costs 4x more but yields mostly duplicates. Quick found 16K+ providers across 78 cities for $100. After dedup/filter, same quality |
| 2026-03-25 | 4 parallel processing/enrichment batches for large batches | Single batch would take ~10hrs for 78 cities. 4 parallel batches cut to ~2.7hrs. Tradeoff: 6 Supabase timeouts from concurrent load (easy sequential retry) |
| 2026-03-25 | Cap parallel enrichment batches at 4 to avoid Supabase timeouts | 4 concurrent `enrich-city.js` processes cause occasional statement timeouts. 3-4 batches is the sweet spot for speed vs stability |
| 2026-03-25 | Place ID dedup before fuzzy dedup | Same place_id = same business (100% precision). Run this first to eliminate obvious dupes, then fuzzy catches the rest. Avoids fuzzy false positives on chains with similar names |
| 2026-03-25 | Claimed accounts get +1000 score in dedup — never deleted | 152 providers linked via business_profiles. Even if a claimed provider is the "worse" record, it has real account data tied to it. Always keep it |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-24 | Highlights are earned, not defaulted — fewer honest > 4 generic | Every Home Care agency showed identical "In-Home Care, Certified Caregivers, Companionship, Light Housekeeping". Users see through it. 1 verified fact ("State Licensed") builds more trust than 4 templated labels |
| 2026-03-24 | Skip capability label on browse cards (skipCapability) | On a Home Care filtered page, showing "In-Home Care" as a highlight is tautological. Category already visible in card header line. Only show Tiers 1-4 (earned signals) on cards |
| 2026-03-24 | "Well Reviewed" at 4.0★/15+ reviews below "Highly Rated" at 4.5★/10+ | Binary "Highly Rated" was too exclusive — many good providers missed Tier 2. Second tier creates visible variety across cards |
| 2026-03-24 | Backfill trust signals for all 22K non-CMS providers (~$22) | Trust signals are the only differentiator for Home Care/Assisted Living/Memory Care/Independent Living (no CMS data). Pipeline already existed, just hadn't been run on pre-existing providers |
| 2026-03-24 | Don't send MedJobs students to Loops seeker audience | Adding students as seeker contacts enrolls them in Logan's care-seeker onboarding drip. Students get their own Resend email flow |
| 2026-03-24 | Collapse 15 acknowledgment checkboxes into single "I agree" | Wall of legal text killed momentum at step 4. Consolidated into 5 summary bullets + one toggle. Same legal coverage, 90% less friction |
| 2026-03-24 | Dark buttons (bg-gray-900) over teal for MedJobs apply | Calm confidence aesthetic. Teal felt like every SaaS template. Dark is quieter, more Linear/Notion |
| 2026-03-24 | Private storage bucket for student documents | Driver's license and car insurance are PII. Unlike profile photos (public), these must be access-controlled |
| 2026-03-24 | Use generateLink to resolve existing auth users | `listUsers` has no email filter in this Supabase version. `generateLink` always returns the user object, even for existing users — clean and efficient |
| 2026-03-24 | Early account creation after step 1, not step 4 | Capture the lead as soon as we have name+email. Students who abandon mid-form can be nudged back. Two-phase: partial on step 1, full update on step 4 |
| 2026-03-24 | Save step 1 data only, not progressive per-step (approach B) | Steps 2-3 (certifications, availability) are fast to re-fill. Simpler than PATCH-per-step. We capture the valuable lead data (name, email, phone, city, state) |
| 2026-03-24 | Auto-sign-in via dual magic link tokens | Generate two magic links: one for email (reusable), one consumed client-side via verifyOtp. Student gets a browser session without clicking the email, nav updates mid-form |
| 2026-03-24 | Dashboard as the canonical return destination | `/portal/medjobs` is the persistent home for students. All magic links, auth redirects, and success screens point here. No more URL-param-dependent flows |
| 2026-03-24 | Hide footer on MedJobs form pages | Senior care discovery footer is wrong context for student application. Apply, submit-video, and portal/medjobs get no footer |
| 2026-03-24 | Typeform hybrid: 4 sections + Typeform components | Pure one-question-per-screen (17 clicks) is friction disguised as simplicity. Keep grouped fields but bring Typeform-quality interactions: borderless inputs, custom dropdowns, letter-badged multi-selects, slide transitions |
| 2026-03-23 | Post-geocoding area check is required | 36/269 Ramapo providers geocoded outside the area — discovery assigns city=Ramapo to everything regardless of actual location. Must validate coordinates fall within ~0.5° of target city after geocoding |
| 2026-03-23 | Slugs must include city to avoid collisions | Many NY providers share names across cities. Slug format `{name}-{city}-{state}` prevents unique constraint violations |
| 2026-03-23 | Don't run google_reviews_data hydration and review snippets in parallel | Both write to the same JSONB column — race condition causes data loss. Run hydration first, then snippets |
| 2026-03-22 | Never store raw Google Places photo reference URLs | Raw `places.googleapis.com/v1/.../photos/...` URLs are ephemeral API resource paths requiring an API key. Must resolve to permanent `lh3.googleusercontent.com` URLs using `skipHttpRedirect=true` |
| 2026-03-22 | Jettison "Add Score" from city pipeline | olera_score/community_Score/value_score/information_availability_score are dead columns from the old Perplexity AI scoring system, removed in commit 302a4e5. New system uses Google Reviews + CMS data + AI Trust Signals |
| 2026-03-22 | Replace "Add Score" with "Hydrate Google Reviews Data" | New pipeline step populates google_reviews_data JSONB (rating, review_count, snippets) instead of the old proprietary scores |
| 2026-03-22 | AI Trust Signals run as part of city pipeline | Unified workflow: after upload, run /api/admin/verify-trust-signals for non-CMS categories in the target city |
| 2026-03-22 | AI classification required before upload | 32% of Bellevue discovery was garbage (Walmart, GameStop, Roto-Rooter). Keyword filtering misses most false positives. Perplexity AI classification costs ~$0.40 per city and catches everything |
| 2026-03-22 | Run enrichment steps in parallel | Post-upload steps (descriptions, reviews, trust signals, images, email) are independent — run concurrently with background tasks. TJ explicitly praised this approach |
| 2026-03-22 | Trust signals + CMS are display-only, not ranking | Current recommendation engine sorts exclusively by evidence density (google rating × log(review count)). Ranking enhancement is a separate Notion task for deep dive |
| 2026-03-13 | Form-first, voice-second in mode selection | Most users expect a form; voice is a differentiator but shouldn't be the default path |
| 2026-03-13 | Auth gate on bookmark only, not on results | Let users see value first → higher conversion. Bookmark is the natural auth moment |
| 2026-03-13 | Web Speech Synthesis API for TTS (no external service) | Free, built into all browsers, zero latency, no API key. Good enough for intake prompts |
| 2026-03-13 | Borrow Chantel's results page ideas, not her code | Her Lovable prototype has great UX patterns (financial impact, action plan, print) but needs to be rebuilt in our stack |
| 2026-03-13 | Progressive disclosure over report layout | Results page had 9 sections — overwhelming. Reduced to 3 beats: hero card, program list, tools. Document checklist behind toggle. |
| 2026-03-13 | "Recommended First Step" hero > Action Plan list | One specific program with call script > 5 programs in a numbered list. Reduces decision paralysis. |
| 2026-03-13 | Remove SaveResultsBanner from results | Show value first, ask later. Auth only on bookmark. Banner was the first thing users saw — wrong priority. |
| 2026-03-13 | Print expands everything via beforeprint event | Progressive disclosure is great for screen, bad for paper. JS listener overrides collapsed state during print. |
| 2026-03-05 | Flat `/provider/{slug}` URL is correct | v1.0 already used flat canonical URLs — no SEO trade-off in migration |
| 2026-03-05 | Gated provider portal → Esther | `/provider-portal/provider/{slug}/*` needs smart landing page, not just redirect. Critical for provider email funnel |
| 2026-03-02 | 16:9 primary featured image, 4 featured articles | 3:2 and 4:3 were too tall — pushed article grid below fold. 4 featured (1 large + 3 small) fills the right column without blank space |
| 2026-03-01 | Skip MedicalBusiness schema, revisit later | Low reward: Google doesn't render it differently than LocalBusiness. No concrete SERP benefit. Competitors don't use it either. |
| 2026-02-28 | CTA: quiet nudge over teal gradient banner | Strip template blobs, one warm heading, one button — calm confidence over SaaS shouting |
| 2026-02-28 | Community section in unified gray container | Docuseries + flat links felt unbounded; single bg-gray-100 rounded card groups them |
| 2026-02-28 | NIH badge: actual logo, compact, bottom-right hero | Real logo image inverted to white; tight but not cramped spacing |
| 2026-02-28 | Uniform grid over bento for Explore Care | Equal-weight cards feel less template-y; bento asymmetry was visual noise |
| 2026-02-28 | Remove social proof trust strip | Fake numbers add no trust; section added no user value |
| 2026-02-28 | Community as editorial + flat link rows | Perena-style flat rows over boxed cards; docuseries gets hero treatment, community links are quiet and scannable |
| 2026-02-28 | Default care type to Home Care | Most common search intent; was incorrectly defaulting to Home Health |
| 2026-02-28 | Self-host bento images over Unsplash | Remove external dependency; own the imagery |
| 2026-02-28 | BrowseCard (compact 310px) for all homepage cards | More providers in less space; save ProviderCard for browse/search pages |
| 2026-02-26 | Only TJ can merge to main/staging | Rulesets + merge-admins team. Prevents uncontrolled merges |
| 2026-02-26 | Content regression checks beyond git merge-base | Revert→re-apply cycles make commit topology misleading |
| 2026-02-26 | PR merge reports go to Notion | Automated reports for audit trail and team visibility |
| 2026-03-10 | Dynamic API route for sitemap, not metadata file | `app/sitemap.ts` is statically generated at build time — Supabase queries fail, empty result cached permanently. `app/api/sitemap/route.ts` with `force-dynamic` works correctly |
| 2026-03-10 | Rewrite `/sitemap.xml` → `/api/sitemap` | `app/[category]` dynamic route catches `sitemap.xml` as a category slug → 404. Rewrite in `next.config.ts` bypasses the route conflict |
| 2026-03-10 | Static OG image over dynamic ImageResponse | Shutterstock photo looks better than teal gradient text; static `.jpg` is simpler and faster |
| 2026-03-10 | Web Speech API + Deepgram fallback for voice | Web Speech API is free and covers ~75% of traffic (Chrome/Edge). Deepgram at $0.008/min covers Firefox + iOS Safari. Cheaper and simpler than a single paid provider for all traffic |
| 2026-03-10 | Keyword parser over LLM for voice interpretation | iOS VoiceIntentParser uses keyword matching and handles all edge cases. No need for Claude API — deterministic, instant, zero cost. LLM can be added later for Plan C conversational mode |
| 2026-03-10 | Mic per step, not separate voice mode | Keeps voice as an enhancement to the existing form. Users can mix voice and tap freely. Lower engineering cost than a full voice overlay (Plan B) |
| 2026-03-10 | Voice on all 6 steps, not just text inputs | Even pill-select steps (care preference, needs, income, Medicaid) benefit from voice — "help with bathing and cooking" is natural speech that maps cleanly to pills |
| 2026-03-10 | Labeled pill over bare icon for voice button | Bare 40x40 gray circle has zero affordance — users won't discover it. Labeled pill with "Speak" text is discoverable without being pushy |
| 2026-03-10 | Teal listening state over red | Red = error/danger in every mental model. Teal (brand color) signals "active" with calm confidence |
| 2026-03-10 | Voice below options, not above | Voice is a secondary input method. Below the primary interaction (input/pills) communicates "or you can speak" without competing with the primary path |
| 2026-03-10 | City search over ZIP-only for voice | Users naturally say "I live in Katy Texas" not "seven seven four four nine". Reuse existing 18K city search infra with state name extraction. ZIP still works if spoken |
| 2026-03-10 | Auto-retry on audio-capture mic error | Chrome's Web Speech API flakes on mic access — abort→start race condition. One silent 500ms retry resolves most transient failures |
| 2026-02-21 | Server-side pagination for directory | 36K+ records — must use Supabase `.range()` |

## Session Log

### 2026-04-27 — Sweep #1 wrap (resume → execution → pipeline updates)

**Resumed** the data-sweep work paused at end of 2026-04-26. TJ had paused review on the deletions + reclass-from-deletions MDs after flagging Lexie Rae's Care Home as another regex amnesia gap.

**Iterated regex 4x (v1 → v2.2):**
- v2: widened AL pattern (drop "for the elderly"), added META_REFS for category-by-name signals ("falls under", "matches", "should be reclassified as"), service vocab broadened
- v2.1: added clause-level negation after TJ flagged ThedaCare Physicians (long-list-of-negation FP that fixed-window check missed)
- v2.2: added definitional-context exclusion + "indicate" META_REF after TJ flagged Joyful Home Health Care (LLM described HHC business model but my regex matched the definitional sentence about HC Non-medical)

**Strategic pivot:** TJ called out that the fix-cycle pattern was a smell — 5+ patches without converging. Stepped back, articulated that regex-on-LLM-free-text is fundamentally fragile, and proposed an LLM self-correction pass with forced-choice anti-amnesia prompt. TJ agreed.

**Executed the pivot:** Wrote `repass-out-of-scope.js` + `regen-from-repass.js`. Re-pass on 2,936 OUT_OF_SCOPE verdicts: 4.1 min, ~$5. Produced 2,582 confirmed deletions / 271 reclass / 83 silent / 0 missing. Generated `disagreements-2026-04-27.md` (233 cases where regex v2.2 vs re-pass diverged) as a third review artifact.

**TJ reviewed all 3 files:** approved. Found one stale-website edge case (`8M1Gdy4` Oakview Park — actually AL/MC, but website field points at a Comfort Keepers office that misled the LLM). Unchecked that row with a TJ override note.

**Executed cleanup:** `execute-cleanup.js` ran in 4.6s. Soft-deleted 2,582 providers, reclassified 270 (Oakview Park stayed AL|MC). Active providers: 73,304 → 70,722. Backup CSVs written before any DB writes.

**Pipeline updates** (this session, ready for PR):
- `scripts/pipeline-batch.js`: 3 prompts unified via `SIX_CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS` + `OUT_OF_SCOPE_TYPES` constants. Tight YES list (the 6) + comprehensive NO list. Each prompt now also returns `category` (one of the 6) for richer signal. Stream B Places call expanded with `types`/`businessStatus`/`addressComponents`, stored in `google_reviews_data.{places_types, business_status, country_code}` for future filter logic.
- `scripts/discovery-batch.py`: search terms tightened, removed contamination sources from sweep #1 (55+, senior apartments, rehab center, cognitive care, memory support, visiting nurse alone, personal care, caregiver). Comment block at top documents the rationale.
- `docs/data-sweep-runbook.md`: updated change log with v2/v2.1/v2.2 + the "scrapped regex for LLM re-pass" learning.
- `SCRATCHPAD.md`: this file.

**Branch state:** `feat/data-sweep-skill` off `origin/staging`. 3 modified files (SCRATCHPAD, pipeline-batch.js, discovery-batch.py), 3 untracked (definitions doc, runbook, skill). Ready to commit + PR.

**Cost summary for sweep #1:** ~$170 total ($0 Tier 1 + $3 calibration + $160 LLM verify on 73K + $5 LLM re-pass + $2 retries). Active providers post-sweep: 70,722.

**Skill + runbook artifacts:**
- `.claude/commands/data-sweep.md` — slash command for sweep #2+
- `docs/data-sweep-runbook.md` — operational details (regex, prompts, cost, change log)
- `docs/provider-category-definitions.md` — source of truth for the 6 categories
