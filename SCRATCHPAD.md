## Session Log

### 2026-02-03

**Hero Section Redesign:**
- Added HousingAnywhere-inspired pill-style search bar (location + care type inputs)
- Added social proof pill above headline ("48,000+ verified providers listed")
- Added background image with overlay for readability
- Changed headline to sentence case ("Find the right care for your loved one")

**Provider Card Spacing Fixes:**
- Set image section to 256px (`h-64`)
- Set content section to 256px (`h-64`) - total card height now 512px
- Standardized vertical stacks:
  - Stack 1: Category (caps) → Provider Name → Location
  - Stack 2: Pricing + Reviews
  - Stack 3: Highlights (anchored to bottom with `mt-auto`)
  - Stack 4 (hover): Accepted Payments (animates in using CSS grid `grid-rows-[0fr]` to `grid-rows-[1fr]`)
- Fixed tooltip z-index issues (badge tooltip now `z-30`, payment tooltip `z-50`)
- Fixed overflow clipping on payment tooltip with `overflow-hidden group-hover:overflow-visible`

**Files Changed:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Hero section, card wrapper height
