  - Phase 1-2 done: monolith → 5 sections, reordered, redundancy removed
  - Phase 3 done: all sections polished — hero, top providers, explore care, community, CTA
  - Phase 4: NIA "Proudly supported by" badge added to hero, within container bounds

## Next Up

1. **Add `hero_image_url` column to `olera-providers`** — needs Supabase migration
2. **Remaining ~2,992 providers without CSV descriptions**
3. **Test Google OAuth end-to-end**
4. **Email notifications** for provider approval/rejection
5. **Community forum flagging** for admin moderation

## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-28 | NIA badge inside container, not viewport edge | Aligns with content bounds of lower sections; smooth bottom gradient for legibility |
| 2026-02-28 | Uniform grid over bento for Explore Care | Equal-weight cards feel less template-y; bento asymmetry was visual noise |
| 2026-02-28 | Remove social proof trust strip | Fake numbers add no trust; section added no user value |
| 2026-02-28 | Community as editorial + flat link rows | Perena-style flat rows over boxed cards; docuseries gets hero treatment, community links are quiet and scannable |
| 2026-02-28 | Default care type to Home Care | Most common search intent; was incorrectly defaulting to Home Health |
| 2026-02-28 | Self-host bento images over Unsplash | Remove external dependency; own the imagery |
| 2026-02-28 | BrowseCard (compact 310px) for all homepage cards | More providers in less space; save ProviderCard for browse/search pages |
| 2026-02-26 | Only TJ can merge to main/staging | Rulesets + merge-admins team. Prevents uncontrolled merges |
| 2026-02-26 | Content regression checks beyond git merge-base | Revert→re-apply cycles make commit topology misleading |
| 2026-02-26 | PR merge reports go to Notion | Automated reports for audit trail and team visibility |
| 2026-02-21 | Server-side pagination for directory | 36K+ records — must use Supabase `.range()` |

## Session Log

### 2026-02-28 (Session 25) — NIA Badge on Hero

**Branch:** `glad-goodall`

**What:** Added "Proudly supported by National Institute on Aging" badge to hero section. Iterated through multiple rounds:
- Started with small frosted-glass pill → too small/invisible
- Switched to icon-only NIH logo + spelled-out text (matching v1.0 site)
- Added smooth bottom gradient for legibility over bright photo areas
- Moved badge inside `max-w-[1312px]` container so it aligns with section content bounds
- Hidden on mobile (`hidden sm:block`) to avoid crowding search bar

**Files:** `components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, `public/images/nia-logo.png`

**Commits:** `57e9550`, `bc20faf`, `7c0cb97`, `28035c5`, `f2374c2`, `c2042b9`

### 2026-02-28 (Session 24) — Homepage Polish Continued

**Branch:** `glad-goodall`

**What:** Continued Phase 3 polish across all remaining sections. Design taste pass using Perena/Airbnb/Claude principles.

- Hero: shortened subtext, defaulted care type to Home Care, "Find local help" link
- Top Providers: honest heading ("Top-rated" not "near you"), subtitle, mobile scroll fade, skeleton count fix
- Explore Care: bento grid → uniform 3-col card grid with self-hosted images
- Social proof trust strip: removed entirely (no user value)
- Community: rebuilt 3x — final version is editorial docuseries layout + Perena-style flat link rows (Discord, Facebook, Resources, Benefits)
- CTA: unchanged
- Page flow: Hero → Top Providers → Explore Care → Community → CTA

**Commits:** `7f4a1f5`, `6caf6c8`, `cfac6d3`, `eccbeb6`, `407471c`, `3cf75f1`

### 2026-02-28 (Session 23) — Homepage Section-by-Section Refactor
