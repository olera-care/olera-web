/**
 * /admin/city-ads — Olera-owned city campaigns.
 *
 * Four blocks, one column, one question each:
 *   Needs you  — leads waiting on a human (unfilled, offer past due, parked past
 *                its morning). Empty most days; when not, first on the page.
 *   Leads      — one line each: who, what, who has it. Tap to open the chain
 *                and the outcome buttons.
 *   Setup      — one line per city. Everything editable lives behind "edit".
 *   Quiz       — paid entry cohorts, quiz starts and contact-step reach.
 *
 * Nothing is an input at rest.
 *
 * Cost per ACCEPTED FAMILY and the family-side conversion rate are still not
 * here by design. Cost per LEAD PER CHANNEL now is, in the Setup block: the
 * city arms are a platform experiment before they are a lead source, Charlotte
 * runs Google, Nextdoor and Meta at once, and that number is what decides which
 * platform we keep. It sits next to the spend fields because it is computed
 * from them the moment they are typed. (The day-5/day-14 Slack reads this page
 * originally deferred those numbers to were never built, so until they are,
 * deferring here means no read at all.)
 *
 * Design pass: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/8faff70d-8262-4ad1-be62-748c0eb13493
