/**
 * Relationships — care seekers.
 *
 * NOT A TABLE. The first version was a four-column grid and every cell stacked
 * two or three lines of its own, so one family became a small page: eleven text
 * objects, four type sizes, three font families, nine forced wrap points. It
 * read as chaos however few chips were on it.
 *
 * So: one flex row per family. Name and one muted line on the left, where it
 * stands on the right. A row earns a third line only when something is actually
 * wrong, which means the loud rows are taller than the quiet ones and the shape
 * of the list is visible before a word of it is read. State is carried by a
 * coloured left rail — red act now, amber waiting on us, nothing otherwise —
 * rather than by five colours of chip.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored. Every value is derived at read time in
 * lib/seeker-touches/timeline.server.ts and put into words in ./present.

/**
 * TABS ARE ACTIONS, NOT STATES.
 *
 * "Waiting on us" held 72 families across four unrelated jobs: answer a text,
 * make a promised call, write down an outcome somebody already gave us, and
 * fix a broken phone number. Working it meant re-deciding what KIND of task
 * each row was, one row at a time, seventy-two times. Splitting on the
 * physical action is what turns the list into a shift somebody can finish.
 *
 * "Providers have it" is deliberately NOT here. It was 295 rows, four times
 * the size of every real queue combined, and there is no action attached to
 * any of them: it means "we handed this over and have never seen what
 * happened", which is a measurement, not a job. Presenting it as a tab beside
 * genuine work implied the two were the same kind of thing and made the board
 * open feeling hopeless. It lives in the strip above as a number instead.
 *
 * "Chase a provider" was tried here and removed for the same reason, which is
 * worth recording because it looked like a real queue. provider_silent is 307
 * rows: past the cold threshold with nothing observable back. Putting a verb
 * on it does not make it workable, and nobody is chasing three hundred
 * agencies. The genuinely actionable version of that signal is the family
 * themselves telling us the provider never got back to them, which is what
 * the "Provider never got back to them" queue holds.
 *
 * That queue replaced "Write down what they told us", which was a defect
 * wearing a verb. It fired whenever a family answered the outcome email AND
 * connections.status still read pending — but status is the in-app accept
 * state and has never moved off pending for a single one of 1,431 inquiries,
 * so the flag fired on every answer ever given, including "yes". It asked a
 * person to transcribe an answer that was already stored, structured, on the
 * connection. Nothing needed writing down. What is worth a human is the
 * subset who said NO, and only while it is still fresh enough to act on:
 * capped at fourteen days, which covers eleven of the thirty-seven answers on
 * record. Uncapped it would be a monument, not a queue — the average "no" is
 * thirty-eight days old and there is nothing useful to say to a family about
 * a referral from last quarter.
