/**
 * The Tasks board, writing.

 * The board itself is one GET next door. This is the other half: the small
 * set of changes an admin makes while reviewing records. It is deliberately
 * narrow — archive, delete, and edit the contact details — because those are
 * what a review pass needs. Completing and deferring tasks come later.
 *
 * Archive and delete are different promises, not two words for the same
 * thing:
 *
 *   archive  the record leaves the board and keeps everything. Reversible,
 *            and self-protecting: the catchment populate skips a provider
 *            that already has a record, archived or not.
 *   delete   the record is destroyed. The foreign keys cascade, so its
 *            tasks, contacts, touchpoints and approvals go with it. Because
 *            nothing is left to skip, the populate would recreate it on the
 *            next run — so a row goes into medjobs_excluded_records first,
 *            carrying a snapshot of what was destroyed.
