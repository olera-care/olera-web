/**
 * Care-seeker relationships — read only.
 *
 * The family counterpart to /api/admin/touches. Every row it returns is derived
 * from tables that already exist and already carry the family's profile id, so
 * this route writes nothing and stores nothing.
 *
 * GET — supported in the browser so a record can be opened without tooling.
 *
 *   /api/admin/seeker-touches                the Relationships list
 *   /api/admin/seeker-touches?seeker=<uuid>  one family's full timeline
 *   ...&days=90                              widen the live-episode window
 *   ...&format=md                            read as markdown in a tab
 *
 * POST — append one touch: a call, a meeting, a text from a personal phone.
 *        Only what the app cannot see for itself; system sends stay in
 *        email_log and are merged at read time.
 *
 *        `reached` is the field that matters. TRUE means we spoke to them and
 *        clears an owed call; FALSE means we tried and did not, and keeps the
 *        row red. Declaring a next action closes the family's earlier open ones.
 *
 * PATCH — { id, done: true } marks a next action done.
 *
 * Auth: admin only.
 */

 * POST now makes one model call before it answers, so the default ceiling is
 * too close to the worst case. A function killed mid-flight would return a
 * failure for a touch that has ALREADY been inserted, and the obvious response
 * to "Could not save that" is to press Log again, which writes it twice.
