   * already honours is_test ("test rows never count", see
   * docs/city-ads/CHANNEL-INFRASTRUCTURE.md), but nothing could set it, which

   * database by hand. Meanwhile a successful submission sends an SMS, posts to
   * Slack, starts the provider chain and fires a Google Ads conversion, so
   * verifying the three landing arms end to end would have meant a dozen real
   * texts and a dozen fake conversions in the campaign whose numbers the
   * day-14 read depends on.
   *
   * AUTHORISED BY HEADER, NOT BY BODY. A body flag would be visible in the page
   * JS and settable by anyone who reads it, which would let a visitor mark
   * their own real request as a test and vanish from the queue. This uses the
   * same `Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` check every cron route in the codebase uses,
   * so the landing page cannot reach it at all.
   *
   * The row is still written, and written the same way, because the point is to
   * prove the insert and its constraints work — not to mock them.
