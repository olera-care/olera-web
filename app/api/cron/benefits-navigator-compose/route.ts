/**
 * GET /api/cron/benefits-navigator-compose
 *
 * Writes the first-step letter for every benefits family 48 hours after
 * intake. It used to be a rung inside family-comms-coordinator, and that is
 * why about one family in five never got a letter (found 2026-09-27):
 *
 *   - The coordinator runs once a day over ~2,300 families and only composed
 *     while `Date.now() - runStart < 180s`. Its whole run takes 3-4 minutes,
 *     so most days the guard was spent before the loop reached many benefits
 *     families. It wrote 1-11 letters a day against ~10 intakes a day.
 *   - The band closed at 10 days, so a family skipped for a week aged out
 *     permanently and silently. 62 families from 28 Aug-24 Sep had no letter.
 *   - A family with no usable first-step program returned null, set nothing,
 *     and was retried first every day, spending the budget again.
 *
 * This route does one thing, hourly, newest intake first so a fresh family
 * never waits behind a backlog. It never sends: the packet builder judges the
 * letter and the scheduler's autopilot sends clean ones, exactly as before.
 *
 * The band runs to 30 days so the families who aged out under the old rung
 * get their letter. The composer already words the timing from the intake
 * date ("on Thursday", "a few weeks ago"), and the autopilot's staleness
 * check reads the letter's age, not the intake's.
