/**
 * Cron endpoint: City Broadcasts
 *
 * Every 30 minutes:
 * 1. Detect new events (questions asked, profiles published)
 * 2. Process pending events
 * 3. Send broadcasts to eligible providers in those cities
 *
 * Triggered by Vercel Cron (every 30 min -- see vercel.json) or by an
 * admin curling locally with the CRON_SECRET bearer token.
 *
 * Auth: requires `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`. Fails closed
 * (401) if CRON_SECRET is unset OR doesn't match.
 *
 * Local testing:
 *   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
 *     http://localhost:3000/api/cron/city-broadcasts
