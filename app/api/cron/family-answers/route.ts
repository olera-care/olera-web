/**
 * GET /api/cron/family-answers
 *
 * Drains pending rows in `family_answer_jobs` — the questions families texted
 * us — and writes a review packet for each. Runs every 5 minutes.
 *
 * This route NEVER SENDS ANYTHING. It researches, drafts, attacks its own
 * draft with an independent model, answers the objections, and stores the
 * result for a human to approve. The only automated message in this subsystem
 * is the acknowledgement, which the Twilio webhook already sent seconds after
 * the family texted.
 *
 * Why a cron rather than doing this in the webhook: the pipeline makes five
 * model calls including web search and takes minutes. Twilio wants a response
 * in well under a second.
 *
 * Volume is roughly one question a day, so the batch size is small on purpose.
 * If the queue ever backs up that is a signal worth looking at, not a throughput
 * problem to solve by raising the limit.
