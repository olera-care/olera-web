/**
 * Local Area Agency on Aging lookup for the benefits-outcome "I want help"
 * landing path. POST, not GET: it banks the ZIP/county on the family profile
 * (no GET may mutate — the hard rule from the email-chip scanners lesson),
 * and it's only ever called by the landing page's fetch, never linked.
 *
 * The intake never captured ZIP or county, and sbf_area_agencies routes by
 * county (TX alone has 57 agencies), so the page asks for a ZIP at the moment
 * the family asks for help and we resolve county → agency here. A state-level
 * fallback match is deliberately NOT returned as an agency — promising the
 * wrong institution is worse than pointing at the Eldercare Locator.
 *
 * POST /api/families/benefits-outcome/aaa  body: { tok: string, zip: string }
