 * The V3 surface, shared by every assigned arm.

 *
 * 1. THE ACTION COLOUR APPEARS EXACTLY ONCE. On the old page primary-700 painted
 *    the wordmark, the Verified ticks, the step numerals AND the button, so the
 *    element that should have been the most salient thing competed with four
 *    others wearing its colour. Isolation is the part of the CTA-colour
 *    literature that replicates; hue mostly is not.
 * 2. NO DISPLAY SERIF. 87% of this traffic is mobile and the audience skews 45
 *    to 70. A 17px system sans is more legible than an editorial serif and
 *    renders without waiting on a webfont.
 * 3. IT IS NOT THE OLERA BRAND. The page is noindex and the visitor has never
 *    heard of Olera; its only jobs are legible and trustworthy.
 *
 * White on #BE123C is about 6.3:1, which clears WCAG AA for normal text.

            Airbnb's pattern, not just "a button that follows you": the bar is
            TWO parts, the terms on the left and the action on the right, with
            the risk reversal sitting under the terms rather than buried in the
            page. Their listing bar reads "From $65 / guest · Free cancellation"
            next to "Show dates"; ours reads what the visitor gets next to what
            the visitor does.

            It renders on one_screen only. The evidence for sticky CTAs is real
            (12-28% on deep-page conversions) but the MECHANISM is "the action
            has scrolled out of view on a long page". Control is a single
            viewport with its button above the fold, so a bar there would add
            furniture and remove nothing. one_screen is long enough for the
            mechanism to apply, which is the whole reason it earns one.

            W3C F110: sticky content that covers a focused control is an
            accessibility failure, so the section above reserves pb-28 and the
            bar sits inside the safe area rather than over it.
