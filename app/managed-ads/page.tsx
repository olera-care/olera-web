/**
 * /managed-ads — the public explainer for Olera Managed Ads.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The product surface at /provider/boost is behind the sign-in wall, so the
 * only thing a provider could be sent before claiming their page was a pitch of
 * three sentences. What we actually run is two ad products, a qualification
 * form, a consent record, a provider relay, a follow-up loop and a standing
 * optimization routine, none of it written anywhere a provider could read it.
 *
 * ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER
 * offer → who we are → what you are buying → see it → the numbers → what they
 * do not prove → why our campaigns are different → how we run them → price →
 * close. The first draft opened with the ledger and closed on the caveats,
 * which is the order an operator writes in and the reverse of the order a buyer
 * reads in.
 *
 * TrackRecord sits at position two because the question that follows the hero
 * is "who are you, and why is this not another marketing firm". It was inside
 * WhatWeKnow until 9 Sep 2026, behind three sections of product mechanics and
 * ~4,500px of scroll, which is past the point a skeptical reader leaves. Note
 * this does NOT reverse the rule above: the thing that must not open the page
 * is the *ledger* — the small client figures that need their caveats attached.
 * A credential is not a ledger.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR EDITING IT
 * Every claim is traceable to code or to a measured campaign, and no number is
 * typed into a section. Hero, strip and limits all read the same stats object,
 * because an earlier version hardcoded $535 in prose two screens under a strip
 * reading $298 and the page contradicted itself. The other guardrails live in
 * the section files: the provider relay is built but dormant, no Meta campaign
 * has ever run *for a provider*, and recorded spend is a floor.
 *
 * TWO SCOPES LIVE ON THIS PAGE. KEEP THEM APART.
 * ResultsTicker and HonestLimits answer "what has Olera done for providers":
 * a few hundred dollars, one confirmed client, scoped to Google provider
 * campaigns in stats.server.ts. TrackRecord answers "can Olera run ads at
 * all": Olera's own acquisition history, two orders of magnitude larger. A
 * visitor who reads the second as money spent on their behalf has been misled,
 * so each set carries its own scope line and neither may be quoted, moved or
 * excerpted without one. When you add a channel to any part of this page, add
 * it to HonestLimits in the same commit.
