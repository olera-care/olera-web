      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page describes the SMS (text message) program operated by Olera Inc.
        (&ldquo;Olera,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;), 1337 W 43rd St.
        Unit #1010, Houston, TX 77018. Olera helps families find and connect with
        senior-care providers. If you give us your mobile number through one of our
        forms, we may text you to support the care search you started with us.
        Participation is optional and always free to cancel.
      </p>

      {/* ── Messages You May Receive ── */}
      <h2>Messages You May Receive</h2>
      <p>These are the only kinds of messages we send:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Care inquiry updates:</strong> alerts when a provider replies
          to or reaches out about a care inquiry you submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Care-benefit results:</strong> the personalized results you
          asked us to send after completing a benefits or care-matching form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and verification:</strong> one-time verification codes
          and account-related notices (for example, confirming a claim of a
          provider listing).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not send marketing or promotional text blasts, and we do not text
        you about anything unrelated to the care search you started.
      </p>

      {/* ── How You Opt In ── */}
      <h2>How You Opt In</h2>
      <p>
        Text messages are never sent unless you ask for them. You opt in by
        entering your mobile phone number into a form on{" "}
        <a href="https://olera.care">olera.care</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Families:</strong> when you send a care inquiry to a provider
          (from any provider page, via the &ldquo;Request details&rdquo; form),
          when you request your care-benefit results, or when you add a phone
          number to your account profile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Care providers:</strong> when you add a phone number to your
          Olera business profile or verify a claim of your provider listing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The phone field is always optional; if you leave it blank, you will not
        receive any texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the point where you enter your number, we display the following consent
        language directly next to the phone field:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        If you add your phone, you agree to receive text messages from Olera about
        your care search (such as provider replies and updates). Msg &amp; data
        rates may apply. Message frequency varies. Reply STOP to opt out, HELP for
        help. See our <a href="/messaging-terms">SMS Terms</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/terms">Terms</a> and <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Submitting the form with a phone number entered is your consent to receive
        the messages described above. Consent to receive texts is not a condition
        of using Olera or of any purchase.
      </p>

      {/* ── What Opt-In Looks Like ── */}
      <h2>What Opt-In Looks Like</h2>
      <p>
        For reference (and for carrier verification), this is the exact consent
        experience on our care-inquiry flow. Step 1: a family requests details
        from a provider by entering an email address:
      </p>
      <Image
        src="/images/sms-optin/optin-step-1-email.png"
        alt="Step 1 — the Request details form on an Olera provider page, where a family enters an email address"

        height={596}
        className="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 my-4 w-full max-w-md h-auto"
      />
      <p>
        Step 2: the follow-up form offers an optional phone field with the consent
        language displayed directly beneath it:
      </p>
      <Image
        src="/images/sms-optin/optin-step-2-phone-consent.png"
        alt="Step 2 — the optional phone number field with SMS consent language displayed directly beneath it"

        height={922}
        className="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 my-4 w-full max-w-md h-auto"
      />

      {/* ── Message Frequency and Cost ── */}
      <h2>Message Frequency and Cost</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Message frequency varies</strong> and depends on your activity,
        such as how many providers respond to your inquiry. Message and data
        rates may apply depending on your mobile carrier and plan.
      </p>

      {/* ── How to Opt Out or Get Help ── */}
      <h2>How to Opt Out or Get Help</h2>
      <p>
        You can cancel at any time. Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message to
        stop receiving texts from Olera; you will receive a single confirmation and
        then no further messages. Reply <strong>HELP</strong> to any message for
        help, or email us at{" "}
