const TEXAS_FAQS: { question: string; answer: string }[] = [
  {
    question: "How do I pay for senior care in Texas?",
    answer: "Texas seniors can pay for care through Medicaid waivers like STAR+PLUS, which covers home care, personal assistance, and assisted living for those who qualify. Other options include Medicare (limited coverage), out-of-pocket, and spend-down strategies for those over the income limit. Most families qualify for more than they realize — a [free benefits check](/benefits/finder) takes 2 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What free services are available for senior citizens in Texas?",
    answer: "Texas offers free or low-cost services including in-home personal care through STAR+PLUS, meal delivery, transportation, adult day care, caregiver respite, legal aid for seniors 60+, and energy bill assistance through LIHEAP. Eligibility depends on income, age, and care needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the income limit for Medicaid in Texas for seniors?",
    answer: "For 2026, the income limit for Texas Medicaid home care waivers is $2,982/month for a single applicant. If your income is higher, you may still qualify using a Miller Trust. The asset limit is $2,000, but your home does not count.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I apply for a Medicaid waiver in Texas?",
    answer: "Call 211 to get on the STAR+PLUS interest list, then apply for Medicaid at YourTexasBenefits.com if not already enrolled. A needs assessment follows and processing takes 1–2 months. Getting on the waitlist early is critical as spots are limited.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get paid to be a caregiver for a family member in Texas?",
    answer: "Yes. Through STAR+PLUS Consumer Directed Services, Medicaid recipients can hire and manage their own caregivers — including friends and certain family members. The family member is paid directly through a financial management agency.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Medicaid pay caregivers in Texas?",
    answer: "Texas Medicaid pays caregivers through the STAR+PLUS program at rates set by the managed care organization. Rates typically range from $10–$17/hour for personal assistance services depending on the region and MCO.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Texas grants for senior citizens?",
    answer: "Texas does not offer direct cash grants to seniors but has programs that function similarly — LIHEAP pays heating and cooling bills directly to utility companies, the Weatherization Assistance Program covers home improvements up to $2,000, and Medicare Savings Programs pay Medicare premiums worth up to $8,000/year.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Medicaid pay for nursing home care in Texas?",
    answer: "Yes, Medicaid does pay for nursing home care in Texas for people who meet financial and medical eligibility requirements. You must have income below $2,901 per month and require a nursing facility level of care, meaning you need significant help with daily activities or full-time medical supervision. Texas also offers the STAR+PLUS program as an alternative, which covers similar services at home so you can avoid a nursing facility altogether.",
