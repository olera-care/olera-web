### 2026-04-06 (Session 68) — Senior Benefits Data Quality System

**Branch:** `noble-pare` | **7 commits pushed**

**Scope:** End-to-end benefits data quality system — from data model through pipeline to admin dashboard.

**Phase 1 — Foundation:**
- Added verification metadata fields to `WaiverProgram` + `BenefitProgram` types
- SQL migration for `sbf_state_programs` + `sbf_federal_programs`
- Ingested Chantel's TX audit: 12 programs corrected (income limits, savings, sources)
- Self-review caught 4 bugs before TJ tested: "Save Free service" UI, FAQ/step content inconsistencies, badge overflow

**Phase 2 — Admin Dashboard:**
- Built `/admin/benefits`: state grid → program detail → content preview
- Deep links to live waiver library pages
- Sidebar link under Operations
- Key design choice: viewer not editor — AI edits data, humans review visually

**Phase 3 — Pipeline v1 (abandoned):**
- Built rigid 5-phase pipeline (discover → verify → generate → QA → finalize)
- Michigan test: 20 programs found but QA gate was meaningless (Perplexity self-assessment, not real verification)
- TJ challenged: "we can do better" — pipeline was doing generic research, not targeted verification

**Phase 4 — Pipeline v2 (exploration-first):**
- Rebuilt as explore → dive → compare → report
- Open-ended questions ("what matters for this program?") instead of predetermined forms
- Compare phase cross-references against existing data with normalized name matching
- Produces 765-line markdown report for human review
- Auto-generates `pipeline-summary.ts` for dashboard

**Phase 5 — Dashboard + Pipeline integration:**
- State cards show pipeline status (explored date, issues found)
- Program rows show inline diffs with amber warnings
- Pipeline summary auto-generated after each run

**Key pivot:** Abandoned predetermined 5-shape taxonomy. Taxonomy comes after exploration across multiple states, not before. "We need enough humility to grant this could be the beginning of the right approach."

### 2026-04-06 (Session 67) — Aging in America: Framer → Olera Web Migration

**Branch:** `thirsty-hugle` | **Merged via PRs #493-498**

- Full AIA migration: dark cinematic index + episode detail pages
- YouTube IDs confirmed, hero image, sitemap, thumbnail fallback
