/**
 * The panel behind every number on the map: what it counts, how it has
 * moved, what that means, and where to go to change it.
 *
 * It exists because a number on its own does not tell you what to do with
 * it. Somebody reading this map wants three things in order — is this good,
 * is it getting better, and what is the next move — and having to leave the
 * page to answer any of them is the reason dashboards go unread.
 *
 * Everything here is derived, never written by hand per node. The diagnosis
 * reads the eight-week series; the only per-node content is the playbook
 * below, which is a judgement about what to do and cannot be computed.

 * looks like a next step and is not one.
