/**
 * The Olera operating map — every step of the marketplace, in one figure.
 *
 * Most nodes carry a live number; the rest render a dash rather than a
 * guess. Wiring a metric is a one-line change at the node, never a layout
 * change: the connectors are computed from measured DOM geometry at draw
 * time, so a card can grow a number, change its label, or change its width
 * and every arrow still lands on it.
 *
 * The one contract that matters: a node's `id` is its identity. `nodeId()`
 * namespaces them so short keys like "cs3" cannot collide with anything else
 * rendered on an admin page. Rename a label freely; renaming an id breaks
 * the wire that references it.
 *
 * The figure is laid out at a fixed FIGURE_WIDTH and then scaled to fit the
 * space on screen — both directions, so the whole map is visible at once
 * without scrolling either way. Laying it out at a fixed size and shrinking
 * it keeps every proportion and line break identical at any size; a fluid
 * layout would reflow labels and quietly change the shape of the funnel on
 * different monitors.
