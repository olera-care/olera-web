/**
 * Hero for the public Managed Ads explainer.
 *
 * Outcome first, then the offer, then one proof number. The earlier draft led
 * with "we run senior care ads for a living", which is a good line for someone
 * who already trusts us and a poor one for a tired agency owner deciding
 * whether to read on. That line now titles the section where it belongs, next
 * to the lessons that earn it.
 *
 * The proof number is computed, never typed. It has to agree with the results
 * strip further down, and the only way to guarantee that is to read the same
 * field. An earlier version quoted the figure in prose while the strip read the
 * database, and the two disagreed on the same screen.
