/**
 * The dual-ad-system section.
 *
 * Providers hear "we run ads" and picture one thing. We run two, they do
 * different jobs, and the difference is the most useful thing on this page:
 * one builds recognition for a name, the other is engineered only to capture a
 * request. Saying which is better at what is more persuasive than claiming
 * either is best at everything.
 *
 * Accuracy note: both live city campaigns are concierge-routed today, meaning a
 * person at Olera calls every family. The automatic relay is built and switches
 * on per city. This section must not describe the relay as what happens now.
 */

/**
 * THE TWO DIAGRAMS
 *
 * Hand-drawn SVG, no library and no image asset, so they stay sharp and cost
 * nothing to load. They sit above the bullets because the difference between
 * these two destinations is *structural*, and structure is the one thing prose
 * has to spend three bullets on and a picture lands before you read a word.
 *
 * WHAT THEY DRAW, AND WHY IT IS NOT A DIAGRAM OF NOUNS
 * Both frames are the same size, so the contrast is density: twenty-four shapes
 * on the provider page against ten on the request page (counted in the DOM, not
 * estimated). That is not a metaphor for the difference, it IS the difference:
 * one page is a
 * storefront a family browses, the other shows one question at a time and is
 * built to be finished. Every shape corresponds to something really on those
 * pages: the nav bar the request page deliberately does not have, the photo
 * grid, the badges, the review rows, the four questions, the progress dots
 * (one question per screen, per app/care/[city]/CityLandingClient.tsx).
 *
 * The single filled element in each is the conversion action, in primary-600.
 * On the left it is small and sits among fifteen other things; on the right it
 * is wide and it is most of the page. That is the whole argument of this
 * section, encoded as size and position rather than asserted in a caption.
 *
 * If you edit these, keep them honest: do not add an element to the request
 * page that the live page does not have, and do not tidy the provider page
 * into something calmer than it is.
