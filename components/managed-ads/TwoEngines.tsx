/**
 * The dual-ad-system section.
 *
 * Providers hear "we run ads" and picture one thing. We run two, they do
 * different jobs, and the difference is the most useful thing on this page:
 * one builds recognition for a name, the other is engineered only to capture a
 * request. Saying which is better at what is more persuasive than claiming
 * either is best at everything.
 *
 * Accuracy note: both live city campaigns are concierge-routed today, meaning a
 * person at Olera calls every family. The automatic relay is built and switches
 * on per city. This section must not describe the relay as what happens now.
