 * Loading state for DashboardHero. Reserves the exact same dimensions as the
 * real hero so swapping in the resolved hero causes no layout shift. The
 * "Hey {firstName}" greeting renders immediately — we have it from the auth
 * context synchronously, so the loading moment is partial-content rather
 * than pure shimmer. Only the headline / subline / CTA pill shimmer.
 *
 * Dark warm-950 background matches the real hero exactly. On desktop the
 * right-side image area is left as solid warm (no skeleton image) — the
 * gradient mask in the real hero softens that edge anyway, and a fake
 * image-shaped placeholder would add visual noise without adding
 * information about what's loading.

  // client-side (DashboardPage gates the whole tree on a client-resolved
  // `profile`), so reading localStorage here is hydration-safe. Rare tradeoff:
  // if a NEW action banner (lead/question) qualifies same-day after a dismiss,
  // it appears without a skeleton — but it animates in via the parent's
  // card-enter wrapper, and a fresh lead surfacing is good news, not jank.
