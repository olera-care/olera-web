/**
 * ProgramBenefitsCard — the "soft lane" conversion card for benefit program
 * pages (the /benefits/[state]/[program] V3 surface).
 *
 * Mirrors the *mechanic* of the provider-page Connection Card (Door A):
 * value first → one email field → one button → trust line. But it's a
 * distinct, self-contained component, NOT the BenefitsDiscoveryModule. The
 * discovery module is question-driven (it infers care need from a Q&A that
 * program pages don't have) and is under active A/B on provider pages — we
 * deliberately don't touch it. Here we reuse only the load-bearing backend:
 *   - /api/benefits/save-results  (family-profile creation + welcome email
 *     that already ships the matched-program breakdown + a /m/{token} link)
 *   - matchesCareNeed             (filter the state's programs for the email)
 *   - trackBenefitsEvent          (funnel analytics, tagged variant="program_card")
 *
 * Post-email enrichment (7 steps):
 *   - After email submission, we show optional enrichment steps to
 *     improve profile completeness from ~21% to ~55%:
 *     1. Who needs care? (Self, Parent, Spouse, Other)
 *     2. How soon? (ASAP, Within a month, In a few months, Just researching)
 *     3. How will you pay? (Medicare, Medicaid, Private insurance, etc.)
 *     4. Want this by text? (phone capture — the SMS-reachability funnel;
 *        DELIBERATELY at this depth: phone is the one ask the dialogue can't
 *        continue without, so the Phase 3 facts go AFTER it, never before.
 *        Server texts the results link immediately so the promise is kept in
 *        seconds, and stores the consent stamp the SMS rungs gate on.)
 *     5-7. Age band / Medicaid / income band (Phase 3 real-situation facts —
 *        the bonus round riding the just-texted-you reciprocity. Each tap
 *        PATCHes immediately so a mid-round abandon loses nothing; Medicaid
 *        is skipped when payment=medicaid, the facts reader already infers
 *        alreadyHas from payment_methods.)
 *   - User can answer any/all or skip to see the success card
 *
 * three_tap arm (program card flow experiment, 2026-09-24; arm assigned by
 * useProgramCardFlow in ProgramPageV3 and passed in as `cardFlow`). The
 * capture step is identical. After the email saves:
 *     1. Who is this for? (Me / A parent / A spouse / Someone else — the
 *        same stored recipient values; sets "you" vs "they" after it)
 *     2. How many people live in your home? (only when the page has an
 *        income table)
 *     3. Is your income under $X a month? (X = the page's own limit for that
 *        household size; Yes / No / Not sure)
 *     → the answer screen: a fixed-string verdict (no AI), the call for the
 *       program they came for (same pick rule as the plan page), what to
 *       say, then quiet "Text me my plan", "2 more questions" (age +
 *       Medicaid) and "See your plan". No inbox banner, no timing or payment
 *       questions.
 *
 * Value-first display:
 *   - savingsRange present (~26% of programs) → lead with "Up to $X/mo"
 *   - empty (~74%)                            → eligibility-first "Could you qualify?"
 *
 * The care need is pre-derived from the program the user is reading (see
 * deriveProgramCareNeed in ProgramPageV3), so there's no care-need step —
 * landing on this program IS the care signal. One field, one tap.
