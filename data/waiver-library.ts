    intro: "If your aging parent needs help with bathing, dressing, or managing medications but wants to avoid a nursing home, MI Choice may pay for home health aides, adult day programs, meal delivery, and other services that let them stay home safely. This Medicaid waiver covers the same level of care they'd get in a nursing facility — but delivered at home or in the community.\n\nYour parent must be 65+ (or disabled if younger) and meet nursing home-level care requirements through a clinical assessment. They also need to qualify financially: monthly income under $2,901 and countable assets under $9,950 (home and one car don't count). The program is available statewide but administered through regional agencies, so wait times and specific services may vary by area.",

The application requires proof of income and assets so the state can determine which program level you qualify for. Processing typically takes 30 to 45 days from the time your completed application is received.

        question: "What is the difference between QMB, SLMB, and QI in Texas Medicare Savings Programs?",
        answer: "The biggest difference is what each program covers. QMB is the most comprehensive, paying for your Medicare premiums, deductibles, and copays, which means Medicare providers cannot bill you for any remaining costs on covered services. SLMB and QI only cover your monthly Part B premium and do not help with deductibles, copays, or coinsurance. QMB has the lowest income limit of the three, while QI allows higher incomes but is funded on a first-come, first-served basis, so applying early in the year is recommended.",

MEPD itself is an entitlement, meaning anyone who meets the requirements is guaranteed coverage by law with no waiting list. The STAR+PLUS Home and Community-Based Services waiver, on the other hand, has limited enrollment slots and may place additional applicants on a waitlist. In short, MEPD gets you approved for Medicaid, and STAR+PLUS is how Texas delivers the care.",

The program is run through the Texas Department of Insurance and staffed by trained volunteers who can help with Medicare enrollment, comparing Medicare Advantage and Medigap plans, understanding Medicare bills, filing appeals, and identifying low-income assistance programs like Medicare Savings Programs or Extra Help. SHIP counselors do not sell insurance products or receive commissions, so their guidance is based entirely on your situation.

Sessions can take place by phone, in person at a local counseling site, or at community events like senior centers and libraries. Most one-on-one sessions last 30 to 60 minutes depending on the complexity of your questions, and counselors recommend scheduling well before key Medicare deadlines like the Annual Enrollment Period (October 15 through December 7). Bring your Medicare card, any plan materials, and a list of your current prescriptions so your counselor can give you the most accurate guidance.",

        question: "How is Texas SHIP different from calling an insurance broker or 1-800-MEDICARE?",
        answer: "Texas SHIP counselors are trained volunteers who work through the Texas Department of Insurance, not licensed insurance agents, which means they have no financial incentive to steer you toward any particular plan. Unlike an insurance broker, a SHIP counselor will never sell you a product or earn a commission from your enrollment decision. Compared to 1-800-MEDICARE, which provides general program information, Texas SHIP offers personalized, one-on-one counseling tailored to your specific health needs, medications, and budget. SHIP counselors can also help with issues that go beyond enrollment, such as disputing Medicare billing errors, filing appeals for denied claims, and screening you for Texas-specific assistance programs.",

        question: "When can I apply for Texas CEAP and how long does it take to get help?",
        answer: "Application periods vary by region because CEAP is administered through local Community Action Agencies across Texas, so you need to contact your local agency to find out when they are accepting applications. Funds are limited and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning the program often runs out of money before everyone who qualifies can be served. It is best to apply as early as possible when your local agency opens its application window. Processing times also vary by agency, but once approved, payment is sent directly to your utility company.",

        question: "Does Texas CEAP pay my electric bill directly or give me cash for energy costs?",

The program covers both heating and cooling costs, which is especially important in Texas where summer electricity bills can spike due to extreme heat. It is not an ongoing monthly benefit, so the single payment is meant to help you get caught up or get ahead on your energy bills. The program generally cannot be used for propane tank purchases or to cover utility security deposits.",

Respite care is also more flexible in delivery, and can include an in-home aide, adult day care, or a short-term facility stay depending on the family's needs.

        question: "Who is eligible for Meals on Wheels Texas and do you have to meet income requirements?",
        answer: "Meals on Wheels Texas programs generally serve adults age 60 and older who are homebound, have difficulty preparing meals on their own, and live within a local program's service area. Eligibility is based on need, not income. There are no income restrictions for most programs funded through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Area Agencies on Aging. Disabled adults under 60 may also qualify depending on the local provider, and anyone can request a referral by calling 2-1-1 Texas or contacting their nearest Meals on Wheels program directly.",

        question: "How do I sign up for Meals on Wheels in Texas and how long does it take to start getting meals?",
        answer: "To sign up, call 2-1-1 Texas or contact your local Meals on Wheels provider, which you can find by entering your zip code at mealsonwheelstexas.org. A caseworker or assessment staff member will conduct a phone or in-home visit to determine eligibility, usually within a few business days of your request.

Volunteers perform a daily safety and wellness check at every meal drop-off, and for many homebound seniors, the volunteer may be the only person they interact with all day. Texas programs also offer wraparound services that vary by region, including home repairs, pet care assistance, durable medical equipment, transportation, and clinical care screenings. The entire network is coordinated through Texas Area Agencies on Aging and funded by federal dollars, state support through HHSC, and local donor contributions, with no cost to the recipient.",

This is because the PACE model depends on a closely coordinated interdisciplinary care team that manages all of your medical services together. However, some PACE organizations may allow you to see a previous specialist on a limited basis if it is pre-authorized as part of your care plan.

Participants who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid typically pay nothing out of pocket for PACE services, with no copays, deductibles, or lifetime limits on approved care. If you have Medicare only and do not qualify for Medicaid, you can still enroll but will be responsible for a monthly premium for the long-term care portion of PACE, which can run several thousand dollars per month, plus a separate premium for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage.",

        question: "How is Texas PACE different from going to a nursing home or other Medicaid programs?",

Unlike traditional Medicaid long-term care, PACE becomes the sole source of all Medicare and Medicaid benefits, bundling medical care, prescriptions, adult day services, transportation, and even dental and vision into one coordinated program. An interdisciplinary team at your local Texas PACE center creates a personalized care plan, and roughly 95% of participants continue living at home rather than in a facility. There is no copayment for participants who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.",

The ombudsman will typically investigate by visiting the facility, speaking with the resident, and working with staff to resolve the concern.

      {
        question: "What is the difference between calling the Texas Long-Term Care Ombudsman versus Adult Protective Services or law enforcement?",

While Adult Protective Services investigates abuse and neglect, and law enforcement handles criminal matters, ombudsmen focus on resolving a broader range of concerns like care quality, rights violations, discharge disputes, and billing problems through advocacy and mediation. The program offers a confidential complaint process and ombudsmen can often resolve issues without formal legal or regulatory action. In serious cases an ombudsman can also help you understand when involving APS or law enforcement may be appropriate.",
