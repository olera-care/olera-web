### 2026-02-20: Design regression — 2-column vertical cards replaced with horizontal single-column

**Symptom**: The browse page's polished 2-column vertical card grid (Realtor.com style, iterated over Sessions 15 and 15b through 6+ commits) was replaced with a horizontal single-column layout in one commit. User noticed immediately and asked for it back.

**Root Cause**: A stale plan was followed without questioning it. Here's the timeline:

1. **Session 15** (initial browse redesign) — plan written with horizontal TripAdvisor-style cards
2. **Session 15b** (polish pass) — design iterated to 2-column vertical cards (`27b24e8`), which the user preferred. The plan was **never updated** to reflect this decision.
3. **This session** — the old plan was given as instructions ("Implement the following plan"). The plan still said "Horizontal layout like TripAdvisor: image on left, content on right" and "single column of BrowseCard components."
4. Claude read the current code (2-column vertical cards), saw it conflicted with the plan, and **followed the plan instead of questioning the discrepancy**. The existing design was overwritten.

The core error: **treating the plan as authoritative when the code told a different story.** The 2-column vertical layout had been deliberately iterated to through multiple commits — it wasn't accidental. But because the plan said "horizontal," the agent rewrote the working design without flagging the conflict.

**Fix**: Reverted BrowseCard to vertical layout and BrowseClient to 2-column grid in `dc56a62`.

**Time to Resolution**: ~10 minutes once the user noticed, but the unnecessary churn touched 2 files and required a revert commit.

**Prevention**: Added to CLAUDE.md:
- When a plan conflicts with the current state of the code, **ask the user** before overwriting — the code may have been intentionally iterated past the plan
- Plans can go stale between sessions; the code is the source of truth for current design intent

**Lesson**: If the code has clearly been iterated (multiple commits refining a design), treat it as an intentional decision — not something to overwrite because a plan doc says otherwise. When in doubt, ask.
