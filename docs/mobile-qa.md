## What to check on every page

When you open a page on your phone, look for these same things every time:

| Check | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| No horizontal scroll | Nothing overflows off the right edge of the screen |
| Single column | Side-by-side layouts collapse and stack vertically |
| Full-width inputs | Form fields and buttons stretch edge to edge |
| Tappable targets | Buttons, links, icons are easy to tap (≥ 44px) |
| Text readable | Font is not too small, nothing cut off or truncated |
| Fixed bars don't overlap | Sticky navs/footers don't permanently hide content |
