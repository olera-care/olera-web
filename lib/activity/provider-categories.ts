/**
 * Provider activity taxonomy — the hierarchy the Activity Center "Providers"
 * tab was missing. Every genuine provider-session event maps to exactly one of
 * six lifecycle categories (plus a "flags" overlay for trust signals). The admin
 * page uses this to render the orientation summary + category navigation, and
 * the API uses it to translate a category into the set of event_types to query.
 *
 * Source of truth — keep PROVIDER_CATEGORIES[*].eventTypes in sync with
 * PROVIDER_ACTION_EVENT_TYPES in app/api/admin/activity/route.ts. Every event
 * type surfaced on the Providers tab should appear in exactly one category here,
 * or it will silently fall into "Other".
