 * Count families delivered by managed-ad campaigns — the Ad Boost ROI signal.
 *
 * A "delivered family" is a campaign-attributed CONVERSION: a family who arrived
 * via a managed-ads link (`utm_source=olera_managed&utm_campaign=<tag>`) and then
 * either
 *   • inquired with the provider     → a `lead_received` provider_activity event, or
 *   • finished the benefits intake    → a `benefits_completed` seeker_activity event,
 * with the campaign's `utm_campaign` on the event metadata. Both are
 * server-confirmed conversions — not clicks — so this is the honest number to
 * show before we ever charge.
 *
 * The inquiry (`lead_received`) is the PRIMARY conversion: an ad points at a
 * provider page, whose natural action is "contact this provider," so that's the
 * funnel most ad-driven families take. `benefits_completed` is the secondary
 * side funnel. Counting only the latter (the old behaviour) systematically
 * read ~0 even when a real inquiry landed — see the Franchil pilot.
 *
 * Dedup: inquiries are deduped within-funnel by connection_id/session_id and
 * benefits completions by family profile_id. A family who did BOTH funnels for
 * the same campaign can count twice — there is no shared key across the two
 * tables (benefits_completed carries no session_id). Negligible at pilot volume;
 * revisit if cross-funnel overlap ever becomes material.
 *
 * Returns a map of campaign_tag → delivered count. Tags with no conversions are
 * present with 0. Scoped to `utm_source=olera_managed` so we only scan managed
 * traffic (cheap at pilot volume).

/**
 * Real campaign performance for the provider-facing live panel: how many people

 *
 * This is deliberately DIFFERENT from countDeliveredByCampaign. That counts
 * `benefits_completed` conversions tagged with the campaign UTM — a side funnel
 * the live provider page mostly doesn't even surface, so for most campaigns it
 * reads ~0 while real inquiries arrive through the page's primary CTA. This
 * instead reads the page's actual traffic + conversion from provider_activity:
 *   visitors = session-deduped `page_view` events, internal traffic excluded
 *   leads    = `lead_received` events (the CTA inquiry — the true conversion)
 *
 * Single-provider attribution by approximation: a managed campaign points only
 * at this provider's page, so "external traffic on the page since launch"
 * ≈ campaign performance. This is deliberately BROADER than
 * `countAdLandingsByCampaign`, which requires the managed UTM on the landing
 * view: a family who clicks the ad, leaves, and returns the next day by
 * searching the provider's name is real campaign traffic that carries no UTM
 * on the second visit. Visitors catches them; ad landings does not. Expect
 * visitors >= landings, and show them as separate numbers rather than letting
 * one stand in for the other.
 *
 * What it must NOT include is us. The `olera_internal` referrer class covers
 * admin directory click-throughs and campaign-URL previews, and it is stripped
 * here — otherwise the count we put in front of a paying provider is inflated
 * with our own clicks. It is a provider-facing number; it has to be clean.
 *
 * `since` is an ISO timestamp (the campaign's launch anchor). provider_activity
 * keys on the URL slug, so pass the provider's slug (plus profile id as a
 * defensive fallback for legacy rows) as `providerIdVariants`.
