/**
 * Apply-along for Medicare Savings, through Social Security's Extra Help
 * application (Phase 5 of the benefits caseworker, 7 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Why this form: under section 113 of MIPPA, an Extra Help (Part D Low Income
 * Subsidy) application sent to Social Security also starts a Medicare Savings
 * application with the state, unless the person says no to sharing it. Social
 * Security sends the state the application even when it turns Extra Help
 * down (California DHCS letter 25-07), so a family in New York or
 * Massachusetts, where Medicare Savings reaches higher incomes, still gets
 * the state's review. One national form starts two programs in every state.
 *
 * Olera never sees or stores a Social Security number. This builds the
 * answer sheet: Social Security's sections in order, each with what the
 * family already told us filled in and what only they hold marked. The
 * family presses submit on Social Security's site themselves.
 *
 * Sources: SSA POMS HI 03010.038 (the i1020 sections, in order) and HI
 * 03010.015 (MIPPA); SSA "Helping someone apply online". Client-safe.
