/**
 * Per-family eligibility over PIPELINE programs (Phase 3, real situation
 * capture — 2026-07-28 handoff).
 *
 * The scored engine (/api/benefits/match) holds the structured eligibility
 * columns (min_age / max_income_single / requires_medicaid / requires_veteran)
 * but lives on the sbf_* DB tables, while every family-facing surface — the
 * /m plan, the cascade first step, program pages — runs on pipeline draft
 * programs with slug ids and prose eligibility. The two universes share no
 * key (waiver_library_url covers only ~530 of 1,629 state rows), so this
 * module bridges them by CANONICAL NAME and applies the engine's rules to
 * the pipeline side.
 *
 * Philosophy (same as getProgramsForFamily): hard-exclude only on facts we
 * HOLD, and only when the name-join or the draft's own text gives us
 * confidence. Unknown facts and unjoined programs always stay in. Income
 * exclusion uses the band FLOOR (the family's whole band must clear the
 * limit); an age requirement with an alternative pathway ("or 18-64 with a
 * disability") never rules anyone out on age.
