/**
 * The redesigned finder's results (/api/benefits/finder).
 *
 * Reads the same fact-checked programs the plan page and letters read, and
 * screens them with the same rules (rankProgramsForFamily). On top of that it
 * decides three things the old results page never said:
 *
 *   1. Likely or Worth checking. "Likely" needs at least one fact the family
 *      gave us that meets the program's own rule, and no open question on its
 *      main tests (a Medicaid program with Medicaid "not sure" is worth
 *      checking, never likely). Everything else is worth checking, with the
 *      reason why.
 *   2. Left out, and why. Programs the family's own answers rule out are
 *      listed, not hidden.
 *   3. One first step, chosen from what the family said would help most.
 *
 * Nothing here claims eligibility. The agency decides, and the page says so.
