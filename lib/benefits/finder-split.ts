/**
 * The finder vs conversation split (7 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Half of the new families who open /benefits/finder are sent to the
 * conversation (/benefits/conversation) instead. The arm is drawn once and
 * kept in this browser, so a family who comes back sees the same thing, and
 * every event from a randomized browser carries it as metadata.split_arm.
 * The daily brief compares the two arms on those events only: the Phase 3
 * test is "caregivers complete the conversation at least as often as the
 * form".
 *
 * Some visits always see the form:
 *  - a browser with a saved form draft or plan (this includes the
 *    conversation's own "Text me this", which hands its plan to the form;
 *    a randomized family keeps its tag there);
 *  - crawlers, so search engines keep seeing the indexed form.
 * Study families (a ?cohort= link, or a browser that once opened one) always
 * get the conversation, the product the CARE-NAV study evaluates, unless
 * they have a saved form to come back to (8 Oct 2026; before that they got
 * the form, because the conversation dropped the tag).
 * A browser that was never randomized (a saved draft from before the split,
 * a study family, a crawler) gets no arm and stays out of the comparison.
 *
 * ?arm=form or ?arm=conversation pins the page for testing; pinned browsers
 * stay out of the comparison too.
