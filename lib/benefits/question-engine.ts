/**
 * The question engine (Phase 3 of the benefits caseworker, started 5 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Given what we know about a family and a state's programs, which question
 * would settle the most programs? The finder asks nine fixed questions and
 * never asks about daily help, savings or disability, though those decide
 * most care programs: 241 of 469 benefit drafts carry a daily-help rule and
 * 205 an asset limit. Here the rules choose the next question and the model
 * only words it.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no model. Eligibility stays in code (the founding
 * principle "hard eligibility lives in code"), and every question it picks
 * can be traced to the rules it would settle.
 *
 * Conservative like the finder engine: only a fact the family gave can rule a
 * program out, and "not sure" is always an answer that settles nothing.
