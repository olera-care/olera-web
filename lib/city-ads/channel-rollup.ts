/**
 * Leads and cost per channel, per city.
 *
 * The city arms are a platform experiment before they are a lead source: we do
 * not yet know whether Google, Nextdoor or Meta is the one worth keeping, and
 * Charlotte is about to run all three at once. `city_campaigns` already keeps
 * spend per channel and `city_leads` already records which channel each lead
 * came from, but nothing joined the two — so the one number that decides which
 * platform survives, cost per lead per channel, could only be got by counting
 * rows by hand. This is that join.
 *
 * Spend and clicks are hand-typed into the campaign row from the ad manager
 * (reference_ad_metrics_are_hand_typed); leads are computed. So a channel can
 * legitimately show leads with no cost yet, and the UI must say "spend not
 * typed" rather than print a confident $0.00 cost per lead.
