/**
 * A/B arms for the /care/{city} paid landing page.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Between 10 Sep 07:22 UTC and 11 Sep 02:08 UTC, 30 paid
 * visitors across Google, Meta and Nextdoor reached this page and not one
 * pressed "Get started". Three channels, three audiences, one shared page,
 * zero first clicks. That is the only thing the first flight measured that it
 * did not set out to measure, and it is the thing worth testing.
 *
 * THE THREE ASSIGNED ARMS ARE THREE ORDERINGS OF THE SAME TWO INGREDIENTS —
 * proof that we can help, and the request. Same content, same design language,
 * three sequences. That is what makes them comparable: a difference between
 * them is a difference in ORDER, not in how much effort went into the page.
 *
 *   guidance         DIAGNOSE, THEN ASK. Two questions return a starting point
 *                    before contact details are asked for, and both answers
 *                    carry into the request rather than being asked twice.
 *
 *
 *   control          The page as it ran. Kept reachable at ?v=control for
 *                    reference; no longer assigned to traffic.
 *
 *   providers_first  PROOF, THEN ASK. The three real local providers move above
 *                    the button, so the first thing on screen is something the
 *                    visitor came for rather than a form.
 *                    Theory: they will not commit before seeing anything real.
 *                    Note this arm only became possible on 10 Sep — the cards
 *                    never rendered for anyone during the whole first flight,
 *                    because the page gated them on the ON CALL texting flag.
 *
 *   one_screen       ASK, THEN PROOF. The whole request on a single screen —
 *                    care type as chips, first name, mobile, consent — with the
 *                    real provider cards BELOW it. Nothing to advance through.
 *                    Theory: the thing we are optimising is COMPLETED
 *                    SUBMISSIONS per paid landing, and every other concept on
 *                    the table changes what happens BEFORE the form while
 *                    leaving the form itself untouched. The form is where a
 *                    submission is actually won or lost and nobody is testing
 *                    it.
 *
 *                    It replaced an earlier `fewer_questions` arm, which cut
 *                    the quiz from four questions to one and was the weakest
 *                    thing on the table: on the first screen it was identical
 *                    to control, so a third of the traffic would have bought a
 *                    copy change. The evidence also went against it —
 *                    multi-step forms outperform single-page ones, and "how
 *                    many questions" and "how they are distributed" are
 *                    separate variables that it conflated.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT AN ARM: RESPONSE TIME. 84% of paid landings arrive
 * outside the 8am-noon callback window, so any same-day promise is a walk-back
 * for most visitors. The resolution is not to align the page to the ad, it is
 * to carry NO timing claim on the first screen at all — it is the one thing we
 * cannot guarantee, and whether we call at 8am or 2pm has no bearing on whether
 * someone submits. Those are decoupled. Control keeps its existing wording
 * because a baseline that quietly improves measures nothing.
 *
 * SAME URL, ALWAYS. Every arm serves from the existing Final URL. Changing an
 * ad's Final URL in this Google account triggers a "Confirm it's you" re-auth
 * that has twice wiped every headline, description and keyword on the campaign
 * (10 Aug, and again during the LumiWell build). A landing-page test must never
 * be worth that risk. Content changes here; Google is not touched.

/**
 * Weighted split: the control is a sanity check, not a measurement.
 *
 * THE OUTCOME IS COMPLETED SUBMISSIONS PER PAID LANDING. CTA presses and form
 * starts diagnose friction; callbacks and conversations are separate downstream
 * outcomes and do not decide which page wins.
 *
 * Control takes 10% because we already have 30 observations on it and none of
 * them converted; spending a third of the remaining money re-measuring that
 * buys nothing. Each challenger takes 30%, which over the ~450 landings the
 * remaining budget supports is ~135 apiece.
 *
 * WHAT THAT SAMPLE CAN AND CANNOT DO. At 135 visitors a true 3% arm shows zero
 * only about 1.6% of the time, so this reliably separates "produces
 * submissions" from "produces none". It CANNOT rank two arms that both work:
 * separating 5% from 10% needs several hundred each. A one-submission gap is
 * noise. And the 10% control at ~45 visitors cannot estimate lift against
 * baseline at all, which is accepted rather than overlooked.
