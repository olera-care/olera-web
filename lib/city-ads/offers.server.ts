/**
 * City lead offer chain — server only.
 *
 * The relay, in order:
 *   private request -> offer to provider #1 (no contact details) -> 30 min ->
 *   #2 -> #3 -> unfilled (Slack, human). A YES claims the lead with ONE
 *   conditional update (accepted_offer_id IS NULL), so a late YES on an
 *   already-taken lead loses cleanly. Only on a claim do the family's details
 *   move: to the provider by text, and the provider's name and number to the
 *   family by text.
 *
 * Staffed hours are 8am to 8pm in the city's zone. Outside them the chain parks
 * (city_leads.next_offer_at) and the cron (/api/cron/city-lead-offers) starts
 * it at 8am. The same cron expires offers past their window and advances.
 *
 * Everything here uses the service-role client. Nothing throws to callers
 * except programmer errors; delivery failures are logged and surfaced in Slack.
