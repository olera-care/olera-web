/**
 * WHERE THIS LEAD IS GOING, AND WHEN.
 *
 * The relay decides one step at a time: it offers to a provider, waits thirty
 * minutes, and only picks the next one when that offer expires. Nothing was
 * ever written down in advance, so from the outside a lead sat at "Open, day 1"
 * and the team had no way to know it was about to go to three agencies, or
 * which three, or at what time. Bessie Brooks went to Assisting Hands,
 * Cambridge Caregivers and Granny NANNIES inside ninety minutes on a Saturday
 * and none of that was visible anywhere until afterwards.
 *
 * This derives the whole plan at read time from exactly the inputs the relay
 * uses — the same city_pool query, the same care-type match, the same
 * thirty-minute window, the same staffed-hours rule. It writes nothing and
 * changes no behaviour. It cannot disagree with what will happen, because it
 * reads what the decision will be made from.
 *
 * Projected times are projections and are labelled as such: an offer that is
 * accepted or declined early moves everything after it earlier.
