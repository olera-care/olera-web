 * PROACTIVE NUDGES (digests, reminders, re-engagement) at a small budget per provider per rolling
 * window. TRANSACTIONAL / real-time mail (a family asked a question, a lead came in, verification)
 * is never a governed nudge → always sends and never counts.
 *
 * The cap is enforced inside sendEmail() — the single chokepoint every send flows through — so it
 * cannot be bypassed by any sender. Rollout scope is controlled by NUDGE_EMAIL_TYPES: start with
 * the highest-volume senders and expand deliberately. See plans/provider-comms-gate.md.
