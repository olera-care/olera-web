/**
 * Email variant registry — the single source of truth for "render every email
 * variant from canned, PII-free sample data." Powers:
 *   - the consolidated Email Gallery (/admin/emails/gallery)
 *   - the per-cron preview (/api/admin/automations/[id]/preview, ?variant=)
 *   - stable shareable per-variant links (/api/admin/emails/sample?id=…&raw=1)
 *
 * Subsumes the old hardcoded digestVariantSample() so provider + family + transactional
 * live in ONE place. See plans/email-gallery.md.
 *
 * Constraints: fixtures MUST be deterministic (no Date.now / Math.random / new Date)
 * and PII-free. Image URLs use the Supabase-hosted stock set (email-proxy safe).
