/**
 * Benefits Cascade — the post-intake help rungs (Phase 2 of the benefits
 * admin work; see the "Phase 2 Redesign" section of the 2026-07-27 handoff).
 *
 * Posture: assume the family has NOT applied (base rate of solo completion of
 * a government benefits application ≈ 0). Rung B1 (day 2-3) shrinks the first
 * step to ten minutes: ONE program, its start-here phone number, a short call
 * script, the top documents to have nearby. Rung B2 (~3 days later) is a
 * check-in whose reply options all point forward; outcome data is the exhaust
 * of helping, never an audit.
 *
 * This module owns first-step program SELECTION + content assembly, and the
 * benefits_cascade metadata shape shared by the coordinator, the capture API,
 * and the admin Families queue. Server-only (reads with the service client).
