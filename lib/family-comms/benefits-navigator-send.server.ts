/**
 * Benefits Care Navigator — the ONE send path for approved letters.
 *
 * Extracted from the admin per-family route so the scheduler cron and TJ's
 * "Send as TJ" button run byte-identical logic: same governance (the
 * benefits_first_step family caps, DNC, suppression — all inside sendEmail),
 * same cascade stamping (B2 keys off first_step_sent_at, so the check-in
 * schedules 3d after the REAL send), same consent-gated SMS companion.
 *
 * SMS quiet hours apply to both trigger paths. A manual click is not proof
 * that it is a civil hour where the family lives; texts outside 8am–8pm park
 * in sms_queue for the next window (email still sends immediately).
 *
 * Timing/gates are mirrored in lib/family-comms/journey.ts (the admin
 * sequence timeline) — keep that in sync when this path changes.
