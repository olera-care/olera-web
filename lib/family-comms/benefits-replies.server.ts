/**
 * Email replies from benefits families.

 * Every navigator letter closes with "You can reply to this email. My team
 * and I read every reply." Replies land in support@olera.care (the letter's
 * Reply-To), where the support inbox syncs them. Until now nothing connected
 * that inbox to the benefits cascade, so a family could write back and still
 * receive the automated check-in two days later, and the /admin/benefits
 * queue never showed that they had written.
 *
 * Called from the support-email sync for each new inbound message matched to
 * a family profile. It records the reply where the queue reads it, pauses
 * the cascade until a person resumes it, and handles a death report the same
 * way the SMS webhook does. Best-effort: a failure here never breaks sync.
