/**
 * Comms journeys — the declarative "which message comes before which" map that
 * /admin/automations/[id] renders as a sequence timeline.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the benefits cascade is ONE family experience executed by
 * TWO crons — the daily coordinator composes B1 drafts and sends B2, while the
 * hourly navigator scheduler fires the TJ-approved letters — so no single cron
 * page can show the whole picture from its own registry entry. This module is
 * the journey-level source both pages share: each page highlights the steps it
 * owns and dims (and links) the ones another automation runs.
 *
 * DRIFT GUARD: timings and gates here are hand-authored mirrors of the real
 * entry + delivery paths in components/providers/BenefitsDiscoveryModule*,
 * components/waiver-library/ProgramBenefitsCard.tsx,
 * app/api/benefits/save-results/route.ts,
 * app/api/cron/family-comms-coordinator/route.ts, and
 * lib/family-comms/benefits-navigator-send.server.ts. If you change a gate,
 * CTA, time band, or rung order there, update the matching step here.
 *
 * Pure data + pure functions, client-safe (the detail page imports directly).
