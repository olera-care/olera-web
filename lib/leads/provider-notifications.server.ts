/**
 * Provider lead notifications, held until the inquiry is qualified or abandoned.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-09-22 every provider-facing notification fired at
 * the instant the family submitted an email address, which is BEFORE the six-step
 * qualifying flow (`EnrichmentState`) runs and before any of it can be answered.
 * Measured over the 90 days to 2026-09-22: 873 inquiries, 485 of them (56%) with
 * no free text at all, and only 342 of 819 enrichment sessions reaching the end.
 * So most providers were told "a family is looking for care" about a row that
 * contained an email address and nothing else. On Franchil's August flight two of
 * three such leads turned out to be caregivers looking for work, and each one
 * sent Hilda "Your Find Families campaign brought in a new family".
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED. The connection is still created immediately and still appears in
 * the provider's in-app inbox immediately. Only the outbound push (email, SMS,
 * WhatsApp) is held, and released by whichever of these comes first:
 *   • the family finishes or skips out of enrichment  → PATCH /api/connections/update-intent
 *   • a 10 minute ceiling elapses                     → cron/lead-notification-release
 * Measured on 353 sessions, median lead→enrichment-finished was 53s, p90 116s,
 * p99 339s, and 352 of 353 landed inside ten minutes. So the ceiling delays
 * nobody who was going to answer. It only delays leads that were never going to
 * carry data.
 *
 * Everything is re-derived from the connection row here rather than passed in from
 * the request, because at release time the request is long gone. That is also why
 * `holdProviderLeadNotifications` persists the managed-ads UTM onto the connection:
 * it previously lived only on the provider_activity event, so a deferred send had
 * no way to know which campaign paid for the lead.
