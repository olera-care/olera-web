/**
 * The seven ladders — what to do, in order, for each kind of thing a
 * university holds.
 *
 * One rung is one task. A rung says what the task is, why it exists, the
 * steps, and what each button does to the record. Nothing about a rung is
 * per-university: the ladder is the operating model, and a university is
 * just a set of records climbing it.
 *
 * Criteria are not replaced by this file. `campus_channels.criteria` is
 * still what makes a channel live, and Health, the 30-day funnel and Site
 * Health all read it — so a rung that proves a criterion says so with
 * `ticks`, and finishing it writes the tick. See lib/medjobs/activation.ts

Just one question: are you ready for us to send your first student? If yes, a one-line reply is all I need.

If there is anything you would rather go through first, tell me and I will either answer it here or find fifteen minutes — whichever suits you.

I hope you are well. [Name] provided me with your contact information to share information about our Student Caregiver Program for {university} pre-health students. I am the Director of the program and would like to invite {org} to participate.

The program may be of service to {org} by establishing a pipeline of talented pre-healthcare professions students from {university} who are seeking eldercare experience as they prepare for careers as doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals.

Please see the attached 2-page document for some program details. If you are interested in learning more about participating or have any initial questions, please let me know, and I can send over more answers and provide additional information on how we could get started working together.

Thank you for your service to the community. Have a great day!

Good to hear from you. Here is the whole thing.

HOW IT WORKS
When a pre-health student near {org} is ready, we send them over — by email and by text, and they are waiting in your portal too. Some will ring your office directly and say they came through the Student Caregiver Program.

Each student arrives as one page: what they are studying, when they can work, what they have done before, and a short video. You invite the ones you want to interview, and you hire on your own terms.

  1. We tell you a student is ready
  2. You invite them to interview
  3. You hire the ones you want
  4. We confirm the hire with you and with them

WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
Tell us and we will only send students who fit — hours, shift types, certifications, anything you will not move on. The easiest thing is to reply to this email and say it in your own words; we will set it up on our side. If you would rather do it yourself, it is all in your portal: {portal_link}

THE TERMS, FOR YOUR REVIEW
Attached. Nothing to sign, and no obligation to carry on — this is a pilot. We will keep sending you students until you hire one and the placement works out. If you like working with our students after that, we agree formal terms then rather than now.

ONE THING BACK FROM YOU
Reply and tell me you are ready to receive your first student and you are clear on what happens when one arrives. If anything is unclear, reply with the question instead and I will answer it here.

When your first student is ready I will get on a call with you then and we will go through reviewing them and inviting them to interview together. And if you would rather talk any of it through sooner — now, at the first student, or later — just say the word.

Thanks for applying to the Student Caregiver Program. Your profile is nearly there — there is one piece still outstanding before we can put you in front of a provider.

Once that is in, I can start matching you to shifts near campus.

I am writing from Dr. Logan DuBose's office. We run the Student Caregiver Program, which places pre-health students at {university} into paid caregiving shifts with licensed local providers.

It is built for the students you advise: paid hands-on patient contact, hours that work around a class schedule, and a reference and recommendation letter at the end. No cost to the student and no cost to the university.

Would you be willing to pass the one-pager to your pre-health list? It is here: {flyer}

Happy to talk it through first if that is easier.

We place pre-health students into paid caregiving shifts with licensed providers near {university}. Members get real patient contact before they apply to professional school, paid, on a schedule that works around classes.

Two ways we usually work with a group like yours:

  · You share the one-pager with your members: {flyer}

Either is fine. Which suits {org} better?

If you can send it round, or if a ten-minute slot at a meeting is easier, let me know which works.

I am writing once, with something that may suit some of your students.

The Student Caregiver Program places pre-health students into paid caregiving shifts with licensed local home care agencies near {university}. They help older adults with supervision, medication reminders, transfers, companionship and personal care — hands-on experience, paid, arranged around a class timetable, and the kind of thing an admissions committee asks about.

Would you be comfortable sharing the one-pager with students you think it fits? {flyer}

If it is easier, we are happy to come and speak for ten minutes at the start of a session instead.

This is the only email you will get from me this term.

With thanks,

I am writing from Dr. Logan DuBose's office before contacting any faculty, so that we do it the way you would want it done.

We run the Student Caregiver Program: pre-health students take paid caregiving shifts with licensed local home care agencies near {university}, arranged around their classes. It gives them hands-on experience with older adults before they apply to professional school.

We would like to write once to a small number of faculty whose students it may suit, asking them to use their own judgement about whether to pass it on. One email each, once a term.

One-pager: {flyer}

Two questions:

  · Are you comfortable with us contacting faculty directly?
  · If so, may we say you were happy for us to get in touch?

If you would rather we did not, say so and we will leave faculty alone here.
