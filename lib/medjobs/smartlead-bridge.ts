 * set (state / suppression / verification / dedupe).
 *
 * NO network, NO DB. The live orchestration (`launchCampaign`) and the

 * drip only. The provider cadence interleaves phone days (3, 5 under
 * v10 — was 0, 1, 5 pre-v10) which stay as CRM `outreach_followup_call`
 * tasks; only the email days (0 `provider_intro`, 3 `provider_followup`,
 * 7 `provider_final`) become Smartlead sequence steps.
