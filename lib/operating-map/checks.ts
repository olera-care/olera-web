/**
 * Relationships between nodes that have to hold if the map is counting
 * correctly.
 *
 * These are not style rules — each one is a statement about the funnel that
 * cannot be false unless something is wrong. A visitor cannot be more
 * numerous than the pages they viewed. A parent has to equal its parts. When
 * one breaks, the map says so rather than presenting a confident wrong
 * number, which is the failure mode worth spending code on: a number nobody
 * questions is more dangerous than a missing one.
 *
 * Checks skip themselves when an input is missing, so an unavailable node
 * reports as unavailable rather than manufacturing a failure.
 *
 * These are not rendered on the map. They ride along in the metrics response
 * under `checks`, to be read on demand rather than shown to everyone who
 * opens the page — an audit is something you run, not something you sit
 * under while trying to read a number.
