/**
 * CR1 — the actions a care seeker takes, not the pages they read.
 *
 * Three ways of asking us for something, and their sum:
 *
 *   CR6a  questions            provider_question_asks
 *   CR6b  connections          provider_activity lead_received
 *   CR6c  benefits assessment  seeker_activity   benefits_completed
 *
 * Questions read `provider_question_asks` rather than the `question_asked`
 * row the same submission also writes to seeker_activity. That is the table
 * network-health counts, and two admin surfaces disagreeing about how many
 * questions were asked would be worse than the duplication.
 *
 * CITY. None of these carry visitor geo — they are form submissions written
 * through three different routes — so the city here is the city the action
 * is ABOUT, which is the reading that matters for a marketplace:
 *
 *   questions and connections   the provider's city; the ask is about them
 *   benefits assessments        the care seeker's own city; no provider
 *                               is involved at all
 *
 * Provider-keyed rows are matched against both the directory id and the slug
 * (see `providerKeysInCity`) because a question is recorded against whatever
 * the page URL said.
 *
 * The two "sent" figures are separate from the three counts and deliberately
 * so: an ask is not a delivery. They count the notification actually leaving
 * for the provider's inbox, which is the step that can silently fail.
 *
 * They are NOT a subset of the asks above them, and can exceed them. A
 * provider whose email address we only discover later gets their whole
 * backlog flushed at once (see lib/admin/send-deferred-notifications.ts), so
 * sends land in a window whose asks belong to earlier ones. There is no
 * reliable join back the other way — the immediate send path does not stamp
 * the question, only the deferred one does — so this is counted as what it
 * is, a flow of sends, and the tooltip says so rather than implying a
 * funnel step that the data cannot support.
