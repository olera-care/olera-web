 * M1–M5 — the user milestone strip: the moments someone stops being traffic
 * and becomes a record we can act on.
 *
 *   M1  care seeker profiles        business_profiles type=family,
 *                                       started / completed / live
 *   M2  provider profiles               provider_activity claim_completed,
 *                                       then verified among them
 *   M3  managed ad signups              ad_campaign_requests, plus repeats
 *   M4  provider staffing signups       staffing_touchpoints system_activated
 *   M5  care worker profiles            business_profiles type=student,
 *                                       started / completed
 *
 * "student" is the stored type for a care worker — MedJobs' original name for
 * them, kept because the column is what it is.
 *
 * M2, M3 and M4 are true events with their own timestamps. M1 and M5 are not,
 * and that difference is real rather than cosmetic: a profile becomes
 * complete when `is_active` flips — a care worker's when their intro video
 * lands, a care seeker's again when their care post is published — and
 * nothing records when that happened. So those two count profiles CREATED in
 * the window that are in that state NOW. A profile created just before the
 * window and finished inside it is missed; one created inside and finished
 * after is counted. The tooltip says so.
 *
 * M1 counts only live profiles, not merely complete ones. A profile nobody
 * can see is not a milestone.
