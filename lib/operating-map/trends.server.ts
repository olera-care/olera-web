/**
 * Which way each number is moving, independent of the range on screen.
 *
 * The map answers "how much" over whatever window you selected. It could not
 * answer "is that good", because a total says nothing about direction. This
 * adds the direction: every node is recounted over eight consecutive weeks,
 * which is enough to draw the shape and to read the two comparisons that
 * matter off it.
 *
 *   week over week   the last full week against the one before  -> the colour
 *   month over month weeks 5-8 against weeks 1-4                -> the arrow
 *   the eight weeks  the sparkline in the tooltip
 *
 * Eight buckets rather than four windows because everything above derives
 * from them. Counting the comparisons separately would have cost the same
 * and produced no shape.
 *
 * Those windows are FIXED. They do not follow the date picker, because a
 * trend that changes shape every time you widen the range is not a trend —
 * it is a different question each time. The tooltip says which window the
 * colour came from so the two readings are never confused.
 *
 * Each node is recounted by calling the same function that produced its
 * number, with a different range. That is the whole point: a trend computed
 * from a second, looser definition would drift away from the number it sits
 * on, and nobody would know which one was wrong.
 *
 * Standing counts — the directory, the universities, the advisors, the city
 * list — get no trend at all. They describe the world as it is now and we
 * keep no history of what it was, so any "change" we printed would be
 * invented.
 *
 * CP2 is left out for a different reason. It counts providers WE contacted,
 * so it moves when somebody runs a batch and sits flat when nobody does — a
 * trend line on it would describe our calendar rather than the market, and
 * be read as the second thing. It is also by some distance the most
 * expensive node to recount eight times over.
