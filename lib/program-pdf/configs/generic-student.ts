/**
 * Generic (campus-agnostic) STUDENT-facing program flyer config.
 *
 * Serves the public /medjobs#help share card, where no campus is in scope, and
 * acts as the fallback for any campus that doesn't yet have its own student
 * config. Per-campus personalization (Texas A&M, etc.) still flows through the
 * partner portal + outreach emails, which know the slug — this is the "any
 * pre-health student, any school" version.
 *
 * Same one-page renderer as every other config (Template.tsx); it just leaves
 * the university-specific labels generic. The QR/CTA goes to the application
 * tagged src=flyer (no campus attribution, since the channel is open share).
