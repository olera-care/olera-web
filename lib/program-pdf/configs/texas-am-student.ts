/**
 * Texas A&M — STUDENT-facing program flyer config.
 *
 * The partner channel (advising offices + student organizations) shares this
 * with pre-health students. It reuses the same one-page renderer as the
 * provider brochure (lib/program-pdf/Template.tsx) but flips every
 * audience-specific label via the optional fields on ProgramPdfConfig, so the
 * sections read for a student deciding whether to JOIN — not for an agency
 * deciding whether to hire (no pricing/vetting/agency framing).
 *
 * To add another university's student flyer: copy this file, swap the name +
 * accent + ctaUrl, and register it in configs/index.ts under the student map.
