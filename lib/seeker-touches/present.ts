/**
 * How a family row is put into words.
 *
 * One module so the screen and the markdown read the same, and so the wording
 * can be argued about in one place rather than in six template literals.
 *
 * THE RULE HERE IS PLAIN ENGLISH. The first version of this page used the
 * vocabulary of the schema — "episode", "dormant", "unreachable", a mono meta
 * line, five chip colours — and the column header had to be explained. A header
 * you have to ask about has failed. Every string below is something a person
 * would actually say out loud about a family.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe.
