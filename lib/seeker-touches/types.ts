/**
 * Care-seeker relationships — shared types and vocabulary.
 *
 * The family counterpart to lib/touches/types.ts. Same three invariants as the
 * provider touch log (migration 205):
 *
 *   1. No stage, no pipeline, no score. Everything on the list is derived at
 *      read time and never stored.
 *   2. Every row says how it knows — which table it came from.
 *   3. System sends stay in email_log; they are merged, never copied.
 *
 * Four things here have no provider equivalent, because a family is not a
 * business:
 *
 *   - REACHABILITY. Provider contact details come from a business listing.
 *     Family details are typed one-handed on a phone, so "we cannot reach them"
 *     is a different state from "they have gone quiet" and must not be filed
 *     under the same flag.
 *   - CONSENT. A provider is a business you may keep emailing. A family has
 *     TCPA consent, quiet hours, a do_not_contact kill switch, and in concierge
 *     cities a checkbox that names Olera and nobody else.
 *   - BLOCKED-ON. A provider's next action is always ours. A family is often
 *     waiting on a provider to call them back, which is a real state with a
 *     real clock and is not our move.
 *   - EPISODE. A provider relationship is permanent. A family relationship is
 *     an episode that opens and closes, so quiet may mean resolved.
