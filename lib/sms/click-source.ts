 * Click attribution for texts.

 * Texts carry a link to the family's plan page, and until now an arrival there
 * was unattributable: /m/{token} bumped a single overwritten last_viewed_at, so
 * 225 of 362 families had "viewed at some point" and nothing said which message
 * sent them or how many times. The Clicked column on /admin/automations was a
 * dash for every text row because nothing ever wrote first_clicked_at.
 *
 * The mechanism is a one-character marker on the link (?s=f) resolved back to
 * an email_type on arrival. Kept to three characters total because SMS bodies
 * are length-budgeted and the plan URL is already long.
 *
 * Email is deliberately NOT marked this way. Apple Mail rewrites links and
 * strips parameters, so a marker there is unreliable; Resend's own click
 * webhook already fills first_clicked_at for email
 * (lib/resend-events.ts). This exists because SMS has no equivalent.

/**
 * Stamp first_clicked_at on the send this arrival came from.

 * Matching: the NEWEST SMS row for this family of this email_type, clicked or
 * not, stamped only if it is still unclicked. The link cannot carry the
 * email_log row id because the URL is built before the row exists, so profile
 * + type + recency is the available join.
 *
 * Selecting the newest row outright rather than the newest UNCLICKED one is
 * load-bearing. Filtering on unclicked meant a second visit skipped past the
 * already-attributed send and stamped an OLDER one, inventing a click on a
 * message nobody opened. 2 of 65 profile+type pairs already have repeat sends,
 * so that was live rather than theoretical. Now a repeat visit finds the newest
 * row already clicked and does nothing.
 *
 * Write-once, mirroring the email path (lib/resend-events.ts), so
 * first_clicked_at means "first arrival" on both channels rather than "most
 * recent" on one.
 *
 * Known imprecision that remains: a family sent the same rung twice who only
 * opens the older link still gets the newer send credited. Bounded, because
 * rungs go out on a cadence rather than in bursts, and it cannot manufacture a
 * click that did not happen — only attribute a real one to the wrong send.
 *
 * Awaited by the caller, not fire-and-forget. The last_viewed_at bump in
 * lib/benefits-token.ts floats safely because it is a single statement; this is
 * a read followed by a write, which doubles the window for Vercel to kill the
 * pending promise after the response. Silently dropping clicks is the one
 * failure this feature cannot tolerate, since undercounting is invisible.
 *
 * Supabase resolves with {data, error} rather than rejecting, so errors are
 * read explicitly and never thrown — an analytics write must not break a
 * family's page.
