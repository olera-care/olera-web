// v8.10.33: tab row reflects the actual operational pipeline, with

//   - Candidates: students who signed up / applied (MedJobs / posted
//     candidates).
//   - Prospects: stakeholders being researched and qualified before
//     outreach starts.
// Archive / All / All Archived / Outbound moved into the ⋯ menu
// (MENU_TABS) — secondary surfaces that don't compete with the
// primary workflow.
// v9.0: tab order surfaces the operational arc — Clients (paying side)
// first, then the supply-side workflow (Candidates → Prospects → ... →
// Partners), with Campuses as the territorial primitive at the end.
// Clients + Campuses are scaffolded in v9.0 Phase 1 with placeholder
// content; their full data model + drawer fork lands in Phase 2.
// v9.0 Phase 6.5: In Basket tabs are entity-keyed (workflow categories)
// with smart-hide based on whether the category has active work. The
// state model (unread / undone) drives bolding + fractions on each
// tab, not the tab axis itself.
//
//   "Prospects 2/7"  ← bolded; 2 unread, 7 active total
//   "Calls 5"        ← unbolded; all read but undone, 5 in queue
//   (Meetings hidden ← 0 active work)
//
// Categories surface in In Basket only when they have active work
// (unread + undone, excluding completed which moves to the Logs page).
// Completed rows move out of In Basket; they don't pad the tab counts.
// v10 (Phase 1 Bullet 4, 2026-06-04): In Basket tab row simplified to the
// four operational hot zones for an admin sitting down to work the funnel:
//
//   Prospects · Calls · Emails · Meetings
//
// Clients / Partners / Candidates move into the ⋯ overflow menu — they're
// warm follow-up surfaces, not the daily-triage row. The TabKey union
// retains them (and `replies`) for backward compatibility with the queue
// endpoint + deep links.
//
// The internal "replies" key is preserved (data layer, queue route, dedicated
// /admin/medjobs/replies page, sidebar URL routing) — only the user-facing
// LABEL changes to "Emails" to reflect the broader event-stream semantics
// (replies + opens + clicks + bounces, per Bullet 8 redesign). A full key
// migration ("replies" → "emails") can happen during Bullet 8 when we're
// touching those surfaces anyway; doing it now would cascade 18+ files for
// a cosmetic win.
//
// Sites is intentionally NOT in either row — it's an organizational anchor
// that lives in the sidebar only. Deep links ?tab=sites still resolve via
// the page's graceful render branch.
//
// Smart-hide tucks empty tabs away; the active tab anchors the bar.
