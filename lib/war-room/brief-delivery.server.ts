 *
 * Two rules shape everything below.

 * **A failed scan is reported as loudly as a successful one.** On 2026-09-20 the
 * 10:30 run died at the dossier step and nobody knew for six hours, because the
 * only way to find out was to query the table. It was the fourth failure of that
 * exact kind and the gaps are closing (13, 11, then 9 days). A brief that only
 * speaks on success is a nicer-looking version of the silence it replaces.
 *
 * **Delivery never fails the scan.** A Slack outage must not turn a completed
 * company read into a failed run.
