/**
 * The founder-facing half of the investigation loop.

 * War Room spends most of its compute deciding that nothing is decision-ready,
 * which is correct and also means the interruption gate is not where its value
 * lives. The value is the probe answers: bounded, read-only measurements of the
 * business that nobody had that morning. `probes.server.ts` writes them to the
 * investigation event trail so the *next scan* can reason over them. This module
 * reads the same rows so a *person* can.
 *
 * Nothing here re-measures anything. A brief is only ever as fresh as the last
 * scan, and it says so.
