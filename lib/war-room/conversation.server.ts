/**
 * Talking to Cortex, rather than only answering it.
 *
 * Until now the founder's DM understood two things: the word "scan", and an
 * answer to the single question most recently asked. Everything else he typed
 * was filed as that answer, whatever it was actually about, and handed to the
 * next scan attributed to him. Cortex trusts that channel more than anything it
 * can query for itself, which is exactly what made feeding it a stray sentence
 * expensive rather than merely useless. And nothing replied, so a sentence
 * landing on the wrong condition looked identical to nothing happening.
 *
 * Three things change that. A question is recognised as a question and answered
 * instead of swallowed. Every captured answer is acknowledged, naming what it
 * was filed against, so a mistake is visible immediately. And a reply typed in
 * the thread of the brief that asked resolves to that exact condition.
 *
 * Answering is deliberately a small, cheap, tool-free call against a bounded
 * context, not a scan. A scan sweeps for what nobody has noticed; this reads
 * back what Cortex already knows. Conflating them is how a question costs two
 * dollars and takes two minutes.

Answer from the supplied record only. If the record does not contain the answer, say so plainly and say what would settle it. Never invent a number, an owner, a date, or a status.

Write for a phone screen. No markdown headers, no bullet lists, no tables. Two or three short paragraphs at most, and one is often right. Slack bold is single asterisks.

Lead with the answer. Do not restate the question. Do not offer to help further.

Never end your reply with a question. Your replies are delivered into the same channel you read from, and a trailing question mark makes a reply look like a new question.

If the record shows something the founder appears to have wrong, say so directly in one sentence.`;
