 * "hand this off": Cortex writes a brief for a Claude Code session.

 * TJ, 2026-09-28, after Cortex listed five Benefits Finder lessons and said
 * "Nothing I can call writes these down, so they live in this chat until you
 * drop them in the branch notes or hand them to Jade": "It would be good if
 * Cortex had that ability so I don't have to keep copying and pasting."
 *
 * Cortex runs on Vercel and cannot reach his Mac, where Jade's briefs live, so
 * its briefs go to cortex_handoffs (migration 265). His /handoff skill lists
 * them next to Jade's and closes them with the PR URL, which Cortex then sees
 * in its record ("that shipped in #2250"). The system writes the row, never the
 * model, so Cortex cannot say it saved something that was not saved.

His own words, quoted, and what he wants done.
## What happened
The facts behind it: names, numbers, dates, ids, file paths, PR numbers, each as the record or a lookup gave it. Say plainly where something is unverified or where you were wrong earlier in the chat.
## What's decided
Only what he decided. Nothing he did not say.
## Open questions
What the session must ask him before building.
## Done when
What finished looks like.
