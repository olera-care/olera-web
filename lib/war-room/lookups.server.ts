 * Cortex's lookups: named, read-only readers over the systems of record.
 *
 * Every "I can't see that" Cortex gave on 2026-09-23 had its answer in a table
 * it was not reading -- who pays, what shipped, who saw the ads nudge, which
 * providers we delivered leads to. Each was first fixed by stuffing one more
 * block into the conversation's context, which only ever covered the
 * questions someone had thought of in advance.
 *
 * This module is the menu instead. The model picks a lookup by name and passes
 * bounded options; it never writes a query. That is the rule the scan's probes
 * already follow (probes.server.ts), for the same reason: each reader is
 * written once, with its joins and id-namespace traps handled inside it, and
 * every count, date comparison and ranking is done here, not by the model --
 * left to the model, all three went wrong repeatedly the same day.

 * The Managed Ads ledger, read live.

 * On 2026-09-23 the founder asked "have any providers subscribed to managed ads
 * in the past week besides Hoop Cares?" Cortex answered from Slack: it said a
 * subscription notification would land in a DM it cannot read, then reported
 * that none of 93 channel messages mentioned one. The answer happened to be
 * right, and the reasoning was wrong: a subscription is a row in
 * `ad_campaign_requests`, not a message. This context carried no product data
 * at all, so the one number the north star counts could only be guessed at from
 * chatter.
 *
 * Small on purpose: every paying provider, and every request, subscription or
 * ending in the last thirty days. Enough to answer "who pays" and "what changed
 * this week" without sending the scan's operating pack.
