/**
 * Provider moments: a provider email the founder should hear about today.
 *
 * On 2026-09-25 Robbie McCullough at Assisting Hands (Dallas) wrote to
 * support@ asking to be Olera's preferred provider for all of North Texas. The
 * founder called it "a big deal" and answered by hand; Cortex never mentioned
 * it. It was not a blind spot. The support inbox had synced the thread,
 * matched it to his provider profile and summarised it as "expressed interest
 * in becoming a preferred provider across North Texas" before the 10:30 scan.
 * Cortex told the founder it never ingests email, and never looked.
 *
 * What this reads: support@olera.care threads only, from the tables the support
 * inbox already fills. Metadata and the inbox's own one-line summary, plus the
 * founder's latest reply read at brief time so the brief can say what he
 * offered. Nothing is copied into War Room tables, and no other inbox is read.
