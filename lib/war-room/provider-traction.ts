 *
 * TJ's activity list, 7 Oct 2026: "Identification and analysis of providers
 * who are getting traction, but not engaged." Traction is families acting on
 * the page in the last 28 days: questions asked, inquiries sent, page views.
 * Engaged is the provider acting: answered, opened a lead, edited the
 * profile, arrived at the dashboard, clicked through from an email.
 *
 * Two lists come out, because they want different things:
 *   unclaimed      demand on a listing nobody owns  -> a claim invitation
 *   claimed_silent demand on a listing someone owns and has not touched in 28 days -> a nudge
 * Claimed is the profile's claim_state; see provider-traction.server.ts for
 * why a claim event is not required.
