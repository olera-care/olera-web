/**
 * The students ladder, checked against the board model.
 *
 * The thing worth asserting here is that order stopped mattering. Three
 * rungs are facts the system can see for itself, and the cases that used to
 * go wrong are the ones where they arrive out of order: a student who
 * finishes their own application before anybody has spoken to them, and one
 * already hired who would otherwise be queued for an introductory call.
 *
 * EVERY RUNG IS ADDRESSED BY NAME. This file used to hold the indices as
 * literals, so the reorder on 30 September broke fourteen assertions at
 * once and none of them said anything useful about what had changed. The
 * indices are also what business_profile_tasks.payload stores, so a test
 * that hard-codes them is a test that cannot tell a reorder from a bug.
