/**
 * Olera - Google Ads metrics sync
 * ============================================================================
 * THIS FILE IS THE CANONICAL COPY. The running code lives inside the Google Ads
 * UI (Tools > Bulk actions > Scripts) because that is the only place it can run,
 * but the version there is a deployment, not the source. Edit here, then paste.
 *
 * WHY THAT MATTERS. A script in the Ads UI gets no code review, no types, and no
 * git history, and it runs holding an OAuth grant scoped to "see, edit, create,
 * and delete your Google Ads accounts and data" -- Google offers no read-only
 * scope, so every script carries delete rights whether it needs them or not.
 * The only real control on that is that a human reads the code before it runs.
 * Keeping the source in the repo is what makes that possible.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. Reads campaign totals for every campaign in the account and
 * POSTs them to Olera, which writes them onto ad_campaign_requests (provider
 * flights) and city_campaigns (Olera-owned city arms), stamped
 * metrics_source='script'. It writes nothing to Google.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Those three columns were hand-typed for the product's whole
 * life. Edmonds Villa's August flight was recorded as $0.00 / 4 impressions.
 * The real figures, returned by this script on its first run, were
 * $43.52 / 391. The numbers are about to be shown to the providers whose money
 * they describe.
 *
 * SETUP
 *   1. Paste into a new script in the Olera account (419-933-1442).
 *   2. Replace SECRET below with the value of ADS_INGEST_SECRET from Vercel.
 *   3. Authorize (one-time, per script).
 *   4. Preview once and read the log before scheduling.
 *   5. Schedule: Hourly.
 *
 * THE FIREWALL DEPENDENCY. Vercel's WAF 429s Google's script servers. The custom
 * rule `ads-metrics-ingest` on the olera-web project bypasses it for the ingest
 * path only. If this script starts failing with 429, check that rule still
 * exists before debugging anything else -- that is the failure mode, and it has
 * precedent: this firewall once blocked Google's own AdsBot sitewide.
